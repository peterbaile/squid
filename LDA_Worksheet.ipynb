            "BOSTON â The streak is over. Again.On a windy Saturday in Cambridge, Mass., Penn football defeated No. 12 Harvard, 35-25, for its first win against the conference foe since 2012, snapping the Crimsonâs 22-game winning streak. The win, which moves the Quakers into a tie for first place in the Ivy League, comes less than two months after the Red and Blue knocked off Villanova for the first time in 104 years.Penn (6-3, 5-1 Ivy) outscored Harvard (8-1, 5-1) in three of four quarters and featured strong play all around. But the star of the game was Justin Watson, who had 249 yards from scrimmage and two long touchdowns. The win puts coach Ray Prioreâs team in position to clinch a share of the Ancient Eight title next week at home against Cornell, which picked up its first win of the season on Saturday.On the Quakersâ first possession of the game, they moved down the field quickly, courtesy of a pass from junior quarterback Alek Torgersen to Watson for a 30-yard gain â one that was amplified by a late hit penalty. On the next play from the Crimsonâs 10, Torgersen ran up the middle on a quarterback draw, breaking a tackle to reach the end zone.After a weak 21-yard punt gave Penn strong field position, a pass to freshman wide receiver Christian Pearson along the right sideline put the Quakers at the Harvard 25. Three plays later, a pass interference penalty on the Crimson set up the Red and Blue at the two. After an incomplete fade pass to Watson, Torgersen ran up the middle into the end zone on a keeper to make it 14-0.With 350 yards rushing and five touchdowns on the ground this season, Torgersen has proven himself willing to run the ball when needed. In fact, he enjoys it.âItâs a lot of fun being able to run the ball on the goal line and punch it in,â he said. âObviously there are a lot of plays before that get you to that point, but I like taking the ball and trying to deliver hits to people.âThe Crimson were quick to respond, as returner Justice Shelton-Mosley ran back the kickoff to the Penn 17. A screen to wide receiver Andrew Fischer placed Harvard at the three-yard line, who then scored on a short pass to tight end Anthony Firkser.However, the Quakers were quick to grab back the momentum. On the third play of the subsequent drive, Torgersen spotted a wide-open Watson, who had burned past safety Scott Peters. The sophomore wide receiver caught a perfect pass in stride and ran it in for a 68-yard touchdown to make it 21-6 before the first quarter had even ended.After Harvard punched it in on a 14-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Seitu Smith II to cut the Penn lead to 21-13, the Crimson got the ball back, and running back Semar Smith â brother of Seituâ ran it in from 15 yards out to pull the defending Ivy champs within two.Penn responded by going three-and-out, and Harvard blocked sophomore Hunter Kelleyâs punt. On their first and only play of the drive, the Crimson ran a trick play, letting Shelton-Mosley air it out for a 28-yard touchdown pass to Firkser. Harvard took a 25-21 lead into halftime after its two-point conversion attempt was no good.âWeâve been saving that one for a while,â Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. âHaving said that, they defended it well. It was quite an amazing throw by a non-quarterback.âThe Quakers opened the second half with a bang, as junior defensive back Lonnie Tuff took a squib kick up to the Harvard 39. A screen to Watson and run up the middle by sophomore Tre Solomon resulted in a first down, setting up Torgersenâs 28-yard strike to senior tight end Ryan Kelly that gave Penn a 28-25 lead.After a Red and Blue turnover-on-downs at the Harvard 45 supplied the Crimson with excellent starting field position, Harvard drove all the way to the Penn 10 before opting on fourth-and-one to attempt a game-tying field goal. Just a week after Penn blocked a game-winning attempt versus Princeton, the special teams came up big once again and blocked the kick.Torgersen then picked up a first down on a scramble before a false start penalty followed by a sack gave the Quakers second-and-21 at their own 21. But a sweep to Watson was all Penn needed, as Watson cut to the right sideline and was off to the races for a 79-yard score, giving the Red and Blue a 35-25 advantage it wouldnât relinquish.âIt was really just the standard outside run; we do it all the time,â Watson said. âThat was the best Iâve ever seen it blocked. There are guys on the ground, [senior wide receiver] Cam [Countryman] pushed a guy all the way out to the sidelines. It was really just get to the outside and run straight up.âAs has been the theme for much of the year, the Penn defense was clutch late in the game. While the Crimson drove down the field to try and make it a one-score game, a Semar Smith fumble deep in Quakersâ territory was recovered by senior safety Ian Dobbins with 3:28 left in the contest.From that point on, the main goal turned to icing the game. Hunter Kelleyâs punt traveled a whopping 63 yards to the Harvard three, and senior defensive back Dylan Muscat sealed the win by picking off Harvard quarterback Scott Hosch.Priore noted the second-half comeback is nothing new for the Quakers, as the team had trailed in all five games of its longest winning streak since 2010.âThe poise reflects right down from the coaches to the kids,â Priore said. âI was really most proud about the kids, how they stayed focused.âNow, with one game remaining in the season, Pennâs game against Cornell next weekend means one thing: A win equals an Ivy title.\n",

            "Penn football can breathe a sigh of relief after picking up its first Ivy League victory of the season against Brown on Saturday. The Quakers found themselves in a dog fight against the Bears and came away with a much-needed victory. Here are five takeaways from Saturday afternoon's action. Penn finally generated a consistent pass-rush One of the Quakers' most glaring weaknesses this season has been their lack of a consistent pass rush. Even with different blitz packages drawn up by defensive coordinator Bob Benson, the Quakers had only one sack in conference play heading into Saturday.  That changed against Brown when, for the first time this season, the Red and Blue pass rush was a strength. The Quakers sacked Brown quarterback EJ Perry eight times and had four quarterback hits, keeping the Boston College transfer on his back for nearly the entire game. Senior linebacker Hunter Hayes was especially effective, generating pressure to force an errant interception by Perry in the third quarter. On Brown's next drive, Hayes knocked the ball out of Perry's hands and Penn scored a defensive touchdown.  Penn was able to put consistent pressure on Perry while sending only three or four guys at a time, but there is a caveat to their success: It came against a Brown offensive line that has allowed a League-high 18 sacks this season in conference play. Regardless, it was encouraging to see the Red and Blue dominate at one of their weakest positions.   Ryan Cragun is the real deal Anyone who has watched Penn football this season has seen Ryan Cragun's name pop up quite frequently in the box score. Cragun has put up monster numbers all season â he leads the Ivy League in receiving yards despite only having played five games so far â and has been Nick Robinson's go-to target in every game this season. The Quakers missed Cragun against Dartmouth, where no Penn receiver topped 43 yards receiving. It appears that the rest of the Ivy League is taking notice. Brown double-teamed Cragun early on, forcing incompletions on Robinson's first three attempts to Cragun. But Cragun still found holes in the Bears' defense, and by halftime, he had nine catches for 120 yards and a touchdown.  Brown played better defense on Cragun in the second half, but he still made a huge 21-yard grab to set the Quakers up for a game-winning field goal. Part of Cragun's success can be attributed to his outstanding ball awareness and route running. He isn't the fastest receiver on the team, but the sophomore wideout is always in the right place at the right time.  Comparisons to Justin Watson are premature, but they're not unfounded. Cragun is putting up Watson-like receiving totals in his first year of action for the Red and Blue, and he'll surely continue to play a large role in the offense for the next two seasons.   The Quakers are missing Karekin Brooks Karekin Brooks leads the Ivy League in rushing with 127 yards per game so far, but Brooks didn't play a single snap against the Bears after sitting out with an injury in the fourth quarter last week against Yale. Brooks might be back next week against Cornell, and his injury isn't believed to be serious. Nonetheless, it's certain that the Quakers are missing his offensive production and playmaking ability.  Filling in for Brooks was senior Abe Willows, who put up 63 yards rushing and two touchdowns last week against Yale. Willows struggled against the Bears, though; he averaged just 3.4 yards per touch on the afternoon as the lead back. Especially against a Brown defense that allows a League-worst 162 rushing yards per game, Willows' performance wasn't encouraging.  Penn still can't contain mobile quarterbacks Penn's defense has been gashed by running quarterbacks this season. Dartmouth's Jared Gerbino, Columbia's Ty Lenhart, and Yale's Kurt Rawlings have each averaged over six yards per carry against the Quakers. Despite being under pressure all game, Brown's Perry still found ample room to run against the Red and Blue defense.  Perry ran for 170 yards â excluding sacks â and three touchdowns, highlighted by a 50-yard touchdown run where he weaved through the Penn defense and coasted into the end zone untouched. It's no secret that the Ivy League is full of running quarterbacks, and Penn's inability to stop mobile quarterbacks from picking up huge chunks of yardage has inhibited its ability to win conference games this season.   The Red and Blue are trending in the right direction After their historically-bad loss to Columbia two weeks ago, it seemed like Penn football had hit rock bottom. But coach Ray Priore and the Quakers regrouped and put up their then-best performance of the season against Yale. Even though they lost to the Elis, their 41-point offensive showing was encouraging.  Despite getting off to a slow start against the Bears, Penn continued to improve, especially on the offensive side of the ball. Cragun and fellow sophomore Rory Starkey made some big catches, and Robinson bought the Quakers valuable time with his legs on Penn's game-winning drive.  None of this is to say that the Quakers don't have things to work on in preparation for their home matchup against Cornell next week. Brown has the worst defense in the Ivy League this year. The Red and Blue were out-gained, 477 to 304, by Brown, they committed eight costly penalties for 93 yards, and Robinson threw a costly interception in the fourth quarter. But getting their first Ivy win is a big step for the Quakers.\n",

            "Now thatâs how you clinch a winning record. On Saturday, Penn football defeated Cornell, 29-22, in a thriller at Franklin Field. The Quakers (6-4, 4-3 Ivy) end the season on a high note, taking four consecutive Ivy battles after three one-possession losses to start their conference slate. Cornell (3-7, 3-4) lost its last three conference games after standing atop the Ivy League a few weeks back at 3-1. Neither team was in contention for the Ivy League championship entering the afternoon, which Yale won with a 6-1 record in conference play.  Sophomore quarterback Nick Robinson replaced senior Will Fischer-Colbrie with 8:21 remaining in the fourth quarter and Penn trailing, 22-21, and proceeded to lead a six-minute, 15-second touchdown drive of 97 yards â one that would stand as the game-winning drive. The Quakers had four plays on that drive gain at least 10 yards, including an acrobatic diving catch from senior wide receiver Justin Watson for 34 yards that set Penn up with first-and-goal from the Cornell 3 with just over two minutes remaining. Senior running back Tre Solomon ran it in the very next play, and Robinson found Watson for the two-point conversion. Now, Penn led 29-22, and Cornell would get one last drive to try to force overtime or possibly win outright.  Starting its final drive with 2:01 left in the game, Cornell drove 72 yards down to the Penn 1. Junior defensive back Sam Philippi thought he had a game-clinching interception about halfway through the drive, but it was called off due to penalty. Three plays later, Cornell quarterback Dalton Banks hit receiver Collin Shaw for 28 yards down the left sideline, and Shaw nearly scored but went out of bounds at the 1-yard line with 18 seconds left. Cornellâs handoff on first-and-goal was thwarted, and Banks then rushed to spike the ball, as the Big Red were out of timeouts. While some Penn players and fans thought Banksâ spike was too late, the officials said Cornell had one more shot. Defensive back Jacob Martin then sniffed out and deflected Banksâ pass attempt to close the game. Martin described that last play from his perspective. âI honestly thought he didnât spike it in time,â Martin said. âWe lined up in our goal-line formation as a defense, he motioned in, I almost tripped because I was trying to get all the way across really fast, came back out. I just ran with my man and he threw it and I batted it down.â  In his final game for the Quakers, Watson was his usual self, finishing with 13 catches for 192 yards and a touchdown. That brought his season line to 80 catches, 1,083 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns â the latter a school record. âIt always feels good to win. Everyone always talks about how you remember your last game more than any others, so Iâm glad Iâm going to be able to remember this one with smiles,â Watson said. âIt encapsulates our senior class and season, just rolling with the punches.â Watson also made Ivy League history, becoming the first player to reach 1,000 receiving yards in three individual seasons, and also to catch at least one pass in 40 consecutive games. He finished his collegiate career with 286 receptions, 3,777 yards and 34 receiving touchdowns â all Penn records. He also extended his streak of games with a touchdown to 10, which already was a school and conference record. The Red and Blue had little trouble moving the ball, only needing to punt twice all game. However, turnovers remained an issue for the Quakers, particularly with Fischer-Colbrie. He threw for 204 yards and a touchdown on 25 attempts, but threw four interceptions. Two were inside the Cornell 10 yard-line, while another was under-thrown to an open Watson who had sprinted past multiple Big Red defenders. Robinson completed five of seven passes for 75 yards on his only drive. Priore said after the game that Fischer-Colbrie took a hit to the ribs during the game and was trying to play through injury, and Priore decided the switch to Robinson was needed. The Quakers again had success on the ground, with sophomore running back Karekin Brooks gaining 147 yards and scoring two first-half touchdowns. Senior Tre Solomon and sophomore Abe Willows combined for 73 yards on 18 carries, plus Solomonâs game-winning touchdown.  After allowing just six points to Harvard a week ago, the Penn defense ceded 421 yards of offense to a Cornell unit that entered the game seventh in points scored in Ancient Eight play. All three of Cornell's touchdown drives included plays of 30+ yards. Shaw had a 35-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter â and almost had a second in the last minute â and Harold Coles had a 44-yard rush and 51-yard reception that also led to scores. Banks finished 19-of-28 for 242 yards passing and a touchdown, while Coles had 122 rushing yards and Shaw had five catches for 98 yards and a touchdown. Penn has now won its last four games and eight of its last 10 against Cornell, which could have secured its first winning season in the Ivy League since 2005 with a win. Instead, the Red and Blue can take solace in knowing that no matter what drama there might have been earlier in the season, at least they went out on their own terms.\n",

            "What could go wrong, did go wrong for most of Penn sprint football's game this weekend.  Penalties, turnovers and a missed field goal were a few of the many miscues that doomed Penn in a 24-14 defeat at home against Army. The vaunted Black Knights' defense proved nearly impenetrable for the Quakers (2-1, 2-0 CSFL South) who scraped together a meager 125 yards of total offense. Sophomore quarterback Eddie Jenkins was often either under duress or unable to find receivers open down the field. On the night, Jenkins was only 12 of 33 for 157 yards with one touchdown and an interception through the air. When his receivers got open, they failed to help their young quarterback, totaling three drops in the first halfâtwo from sophomore tight end Billy Murphy and one from senior wide receiver Marcus Jones. By the end of the first half, Penn was down 17-0. An offense that usually relies heavily on its run game put up only five rushing yards the entire first half. âWe did nothing as an offense to begin the game. The defense kept us in there,â Jenkins reflected. âWe shot ourselves in the foot more than a couple times.â In particular, the offense failed to put themselves in reasonable third down situations. âInstead of being second and five, third and four we found ourselves in 2nd & 15 âs, 3rd & 20âs,â Jenkins said. âItâs a lot harder to move the ball when you get in those situations.â Conversely, the defense was the only thing keeping Penn in the game. One of the unitâs biggest moments of the first half came after a Jenkins fumble led to an Army recovery at Pennâs own three-yard line.   At this point, Army (3-0, 2-0 CSFL North) was up 7-0 with 9:52 left in the second quarter on the verge of making it a two-touchdown game. However, Penn had other plans, holding Army to a field goal after stuffing a run up the middle on third down. âWe had a lot of gut checks throughout the game,â freshman linebacker Connor Ashton said. âWe just had to make big plays.â On the Black Knights' next offensive possession after the made field goal, Army quarterback Keegan West found wide receiver Clayton Carter on a 54-yard bomb.  An interception at the end of the first half by Ashton after a touchdown-saving shoestring tackle from junior defensive back Guesippe Bevacqua the play before kept the game from getting completely out of hand before the intermission.  But throughout most of the second half, Penn continued to get in its own way. After the offense once again failed to move the chains, the Red and Blue were forced to punt near their own goal line. With less room to avoid the oncoming rush, punter Matt Caltabiano was powerless against a herd of Army defenders who swarmed him and recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchdown. At this point, Army had a seemingly insurmountable 24-0 lead. Following the botched punt, on Armyâs next offensive possession, the Penn defense was finally able to force and recover a fumble. However, Jenkins gave it right back, fumbling for the second time within his own 10-yard line. After another incredible defensive stand, Penn forced a missed field goal. From that point on, the Quakers' fortunes changed. With 3:06 left in the game, freshman defensive back Michael Doulong gave Penn the spark it needed, returning a 65-yard interception for a touchdown. Following a failed quarterback draw by Jenkins, Penn found itself down 24-6. Penn still needed more players to step up to have a shot at a comeback, and sophomore kicker Theodoros Papazekos (who is also a DP Sports staffer) was the man for the job. On the ensuing onside kick attempt, he dribbled the kick until it shot up over the line of the Army onside recovery team and into the grasp of the Quakers. Jenkins later found senior wide receiver Aiden Kelly for a 17-yard touchdown, following that up with a two-point conversion to Jones. With 2:02 left, Penn found itself down only 24-14. Once again, the Red and Blue needed another onside kick to keep the comeback alive. However, instead of going back to Papazekos, the coaching staff elected to have Papazekos fake the onside attempt and have freshman Benji Robinov attempt a pooch kick. Army recovered the kick, but Penn coach Bill Wagner defended the decision to not let Papazekos attempt the same onside kick that had worked the first time, insisting that the second play failed in execution and not in concept.  Even after the failed onside kick from Robinov, Army gave Penn another chance after a botched snap on a punt attempt on fourth down led to a first and goal for Penn from the eight yard line, and a pass interference on a play intended for Jones led to a first and goal from the two yard line. But after three failed attempts to punch it in, Papazekos missed a chip shot field goal to seal Penn's fate and leave a remarkable comeback effort just a bit short.  âWe continued to play, we continued to go after them, we didnât pack it in all the way up to the last play of the game,â Wagner said of his team's ferocious comeback. âWeâve got to protect the quarterback, weâve got to block for the guy thatâs carrying the ball and we didnât do that. [But] I think our defense played extremely well.â Looking forward, Pennâs season is not over. However, it will need to to win out in the regular season if it hopes to win the South Division and face Army, the probable North Division champion, in the Collegiate Sprint Football League championship. For now though, Penn is worried about fixing its own issues, particularly on the offensive end, before it worries about repeating as CSFL champion. \n",

            "As September approaches, so too does Penn footballâs opening contest. The Quakers kick off their season with two nonconference games before facing Fordham in early October. But what should coach Ray Prioreâs squad look for against its non-Ivy foes? See below:Matchup: LehighDate: Sept. 19 at 12:30 p.m.Where: Bethlehem, Pa.2014 Record: 3-8Conference: Patriot LeagueThe Mountain Hawks may be the Quakersâ first opponent of the season, but Lehigh will play in two contests prior to hosting Penn. Led by coach Andy Coen, ot finished 3-8 last year in what was Coenâs first losing season since 2009.Junior quarterback Nick Shafnisky returns for his second year as the starter. In 2014, he struggled to the tune of a 59.4 percent completion percentage and a 14 to 12 touchdown-to-interception ratio. But he was also a threat in the running game, gaining 746 yards and six scores on the ground.Perhaps the Mountain Hawksâ top threat on offense is sophomore wide receiver Troy Pelletier, who led the team in receiving in his freshman season with 49 catches for 815 yards and seven touchdowns. He has shown a penchant for big games, as evidenced by his three different contests of 100-plus receiving yards, including his behemoth 10-catch, 214-yard game against Holy Cross.Apart from Shafnisky and Pelletier, it is unclear who will be the players to watch on offense. Last seasonâs leading rusher, Rich Sodeke, has graduated along with the teamâs second-leading receiver, Josh Parris. The latterâs 635 receiving yards were 413 more than the third-most-productive receiver.On defense, Lehigh brings back its two leading tacklers from 2014 â both junior linebackers â in second team All-Patriot League selection Colton Caslow and Pierce Ripanti. Caslow recorded 67 tackles while missing one-and-a-half games and Ripanti logged 75.Matchup: VillanovaDate: Sept. 24 at 7 p.m.Where: Villanova, Pa.2014 Record: 11-3Conference: Colonial Athletic AssociationPenn will travel to Villanova for some Thursday night football, a game that was rescheduled because of the papal visit that weekend. Villanovaâs Andy Talley will face off with coach Ray Priore in the formerâs first matchup with the Quakers since Al Bagnoli left the program. Ironically, Talley was instrumental in Bagnoliâs hire at Columbia University in February.In last yearâs matchup at Franklin Field, the Wildcats routed the Quakers, 41-7, with all the scoring plays occurring in the first half. Then-junior quarterback John Robertson threw for 230 yards and four touchdowns, and the Wildcat defense stopped Pennâs offense multiple times in its own territory. For the Red and Blue, then-senior running back Kyle Wilcox provided the team with its only score on a 67-yard scamper.Robertson is a holdover on this yearâs team, but two of his top weapons, wide receiver Poppy Livers and running back Kevin Monangai, have graduated. Livers caught 67 passes for 987 yards and nine touchdowns, while Monangai rushed for 1,138 yards and 12 touchdowns. Robertson himself broke the 1,000-yard barrier, gaining 1,272 yards along with 11 rushing touchdowns, while he also had 35 touchdowns through the air.Villanova also sees its leading tackler from 2014 back this year in senior linebacker Don Cherry. He wreaked havoc on opposing offenses last year, totaling 134 tackles (21.5 for loss), 10 sacks and 5.5 forced fumbles.Matchup: FordhamDate: Oct. 10 at 1 p.m.Where: Franklin Field2014 Record: 11-3Conference: Patriot LeagueCoach Joe Moorheadâs Fordham was a force on offense last season, but the team might not be as powerful after the loss of several key players.Among those no longer with the team is quarterback Mike Nebrich, who won the Patriot Leagueâs Offensive Player of the Year designation in his senior campaign with totals of 3,599 passing yards and 30 touchdowns. Also gone are Brian Wetzel, Tebucky Jones and Sam Ajala, three receivers who each surpassed 1,000 receiving yards last year.One key player that will be returning for the Rams is sophomore running back Chase Edmonds. After a freshman season in which he logged 1,838 rushing yards and 23 rushing touchdowns, Edmonds won numerous accolades and has already been added to several preseason watch lists. In addition, he was recently named the Patriot League Preseason Offensive Player of the Year.Fordham also lost its top four tacklers from last year along with defensive lineman Brett Biestek, who led the team with 18 tackles for loss in 2014.In last yearâs matchup, the Rams trampled the Quakers, 60-22. Although then-sophomore quarterback Alek Torgersen threw for 316 yards through the air, three different running backs had rushes of 40 or more yards and placekicker Jimmy Gammill connected on five field goals, Pennâs defense did not have an answer for Fordhamâs offense. Nebrich threw for 566 yards and six touchdowns, while Edmonds ran for 107 yards and a touchdown. Jones and Ajala combined for 402 receiving yards and three scores. And after Fordhamâs DeAndre Slate ran back a fumble recovery for a touchdown with 2:48 remaining in the first quarter, the Quakers trailed for the remainder of the game.\n",

On Penn's opening possession, he faked a handoff and scampered six yards for a touchdown, notching his first career rushing score and putting Penn (0-1) up, 7-0.Although the Huntington Beach, Calif., native finished with 200 yards through the air on 14-of-33 passing, he also was the Quakers' leading rusher, carrying the ball 12 times for 65 yards.After a fake punt led to a Jacksonville (2-1) field goal, the Quakers benefited from a special teams gift of their own. A muffed Dolphins' punt gave Penn the ball in prime field position, and 30 yards from Lyle Marsh set the Red and Blue up for one-yard touchdown run by sophomore quarterback-turned-wide receiver Adam Strouss.That drive ended up being the final action of the day for Marsh. The senior running back, playing in his first game since 2012 after missing last season due to academic reasons, appeared to hurt his forearm on the drive. Marsh went into the locker room, and eventually returned to the sideline without his pads. \"We were a little shorthanded in the backfield and [Torgersen] is an effective runner, so he and Adam were able to carry a little bit of the workload after Marsh got hurt,\" Bagnoli said.Although Penn's defense looked stout early, the Dolphins finally started to click. Sophomore running back Ulysses Bryant â who finished with 127 yards after going for 168 yards and two touchdowns against San Diego last weekend â finally got going on the ground, and Bell began finding his receivers downfield.Bell threw the first of his four touchdown passes to senior wide receiver Andrew Robustelli with 5:43 left in the first half. The Dolphins also tacked on a field goal to head into the locker room only down four.After Penn stalled on its opening drive to begin the second half, Bell took over again. The Fleming Island, Fla., native found junior wide receiver Andy Jones for a 28-yard score to give Jacksonville its first lead of the day.\"We had trouble generating a pass rush out of a four-man front,\" Bagnoli said. \"To their credit, they took advantage of it.\"But the Quakers did not falter. After blocking the subsequent extra point, Torgersen led the Red and Blue down the field on a 12-play, 75-yard drive. On third and 10 from the Dolphins' 17, the sophomore quarterback threw off his back foot and found junior tight end Ryan Kelly for the touchdown.Immediately following the score â Kelly's first career reception â senior defensive back Dan Wilk picked off Bell's underthrown pass on the Dolphins' first play, giving Penn the ball right back. Five plays later, Strouss found the end zone again on a three-yard run.The Quakers looked to be in control of the game heading into the fourth quarter. But as the monsoon-like rain picked up, Torgersen threw an ill-timed interception with the Quakers driving to put the game out of reach. After the pick and trailing 31-19, Bell found Bryant in the flat for a seven-yard touchdown, cutting the Quakers' lead to five with 6:18 remaining.Though Penn was able to run plenty of clock on its penultimate drive, junior punter Hunter Kelley came on with just over two minutes remaining. Solid in his first action as the Quakers' go-to punter, Kelley managed to pin the Dolphins at their own 13 with 2:32 to go. That's when Bell went to work one final time. Eventually faced with a 4th and 4 at midfield, Bell hooked up with Jones for an eight yard gain.Two plays later, the real damage was done.Bell dropped back and threw a deep ball to Randle in the front left side of the end zone. Penn senior defensive back Evan Jackson dove to try and break the pass up, but Randle maintained concentration and pulled in the game-winning score. Bryant converted the two-point conversion to give Jacksonville a 34-31 lead with 39 seconds left.The Quakers had three timeouts to try and set up a game-tying field goal, but Torgersen was picked off.\"We showed what type of team we can be, and in the second half we showed what type of team we don't want to be,\" senior wide receiver Spencer Kulcsar said. \"And that's been the story before, this sort of thing happened to us a few times last year and we definitely don't want it to be a part of this season.\"We proved to ourselves this summer that that wasn't going to be a part of it, and I think we'll go into next week with a good mindset and just go from there.\"The Red and Blue will play their home opener next Saturday against Villanova. \n",

            "Either Penn or Harvard has had at least a share of the Ivy League football championship for the last eight seasons. It looks like this will be the ninth.Penn football will trek to Cambridge, Mass., for a matchup with unbeaten No. 12 Harvard in what will likely be the deciding factor in the Ivy League title race. The Quakers (5-3, 4-1 Ivy) enter on a four-game winning streak, the second-longest active streak in the league behind the aforementioned Crimson (8-0, 5-0) squad that has come out victorious in its last 22 games.As Penn and Harvard are the only two Ivy teams to currently control their own championship destinies, this matchup will have significant implications on who wins the Ancient Eight. A triumph for the Quakers would put them in position to clinch at least a share of the Ivy title next week at home versus Cornell, while a loss would eliminate the Red and Blue from title contention. Coach Ray Priore, who has won 10 Ivy League championships since joining Pennâs staff in 1987, is not fazed by whatâs on the line.âYou try to downplay it,â Priore said. âYou try to say, âItâs just another game,â which it is. Every game is a big one, right? Because we donât beat Columbia, weâre not here. We donât beat Yale, weâre not here. Brown, Princeton. So theyâre all big games, they just get bigger as you start having success.âSenior linebacker Tyler Drake, who was a freshman on the 2012 Ivy champion Quakers' squad, sees a similar football team to the one that beat then-No. 25 Harvard on the penultimate week of the season at Franklin Field and ultimately edged the Crimson by a single game in the conference standings.âWe have a confidence about us similar to the 2012 team, and we are executing like we did back in 2012 as well,â he said.Penn enters having won its last four contests â all Ivy matchups â by dominating the second half. In all four wins against Columbia, Yale, Brown and Princeton, the Quakers trailed at some point in the first quarter. However, they have more than made up for slow starts by outscoring those opponents by 75 points after the opening period. Drake credits the Red and Blueâs âmental toughnessâ to its ability to get better as games go along.âI think it's a testament to the coaches and players that have been able to make adjustments to the game plan during the game,â Drake said. âNobody had panicked, nobody has worried. Everyone is poised and responds to adversity really well.âThe Penn offense has been humming under first-year coordinator John Reagan, with junior quarterback Alek Torgersen now up to 1,556 passing yards with a sterling 69.7 completion percentage and a 15:2 touchdown-to-interception ratio. His top receiver, sophomore Justin Watson, has 56 receptions for 800 yards and six touchdowns after scoring in each of the Red and Blueâs first four games, and the backfield tandem of junior Brian Schoenauer and sophomore Tre Solomon has combined for 925 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns. The unit will have a tough matchup with a Harvard defense that has allowed only 39 combined points in its last six games.Last year, the Quakers, fired up for the final home game at Franklin Field for former coach Al Bagnoli, opened strong against the visiting Crimson â commanding a 24-17 lead after three quarters. However, the Red and Blue came undone in the fourth and allowed 17 unanswered points, sandwiched around two Penn three-and-outs. They were unable to come back, ultimately falling 34-24.Through the air, Torgersen was 27 of 43 for 211 yards and a touchdown, and he was also the Quakersâ most effective rusher, with 55 yards gained and a score. 20 of Torgersenâs completions and 156 of his passing yards went to the trio of Watson and then-seniors Spencer Kulcsar and Conner Scott. Then-senior linebacker Dan Davis made a game-high 12 tackles and forced a fumble, and current seniors Ian Dobbins and Jack Madden both picked off Crimson quarterback Scott Hosch.On the other side, Harvard running back Paul Stanton, Jr., bulldozed through the Penn defense for 235 yards and three touchdowns on 22 carries. Most of that damage was done in the first half, where Stanton accrued 173 of his yards in part thanks to touchdown runs of 42 and 75 yards, respectively. Hosch finished the day 13 of 20 for 174 passing yards, including a touchdown pass to Tyler Hamblin.Harvard has retained its best player in Stanton, who has run for 735 yards on 134 attempts (5.5 per-rush average) with nine rushing touchdowns through eight games. In the passing game, Hosch has shown improvement from last season and claims 2,261 passing yards, an Ivy-best 16 touchdowns against only four interceptions as well as an league-leading 8.9 yards per attempt. Priore said Harvardâs efficiency through the air and on the ground prevents Penn from overplaying one aspect of the Crimson offense.âThey do a great blend of a little bit of both, so if you key too much on the run, they beat you on the pass. You look to the pass, they beat you on the run,â Priore said. âItâs all about opportunity, all about us controlling the football, itâs all about the ball. I think at the end of the day, the team that makes fewer mistakes with the football will end up being the team thatâs probably victorious.âPennâs record in the series against Harvard is 35-48-2. A 36th win would clinch Penn a winning record in Prioreâs first season as head coach.\n",

            "NEWARK, Del. â Penn and Delaware are separated by 42 miles, but there wasnât much of a difference between the way the two teams played Saturday afternoon.  In a tightly contested season opener, Penn football ultimately fell to the No. 20 Blue Hens, 28-27. A failed two-point conversion attempt after a punt return for a touchdown ultimately ended up costing the Red and Blue (0-1) the victory. In the pair's first matchup since 1983, Delaware (3-1) struck first as quarterback Nolan Henderson led a picture-perfect five-play, 72-yard drive capped by a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Thyrick Pitts. On the Quakers' opening drive, senior quarterback Nick Robinson missed senior running back Karekin Brooks on a routine screen pass that resulted in a fumble. The Quakers punted back to Delaware, who promptly marched down the field thanks to big gains by running back Andre Robinson. \"We had some miscues â some false starts, some delay of game penalties â and we also had a high snap, which is one too many,\" coach Ray Priore said. \"At the end of the day, this stuff gets better as you play more football. It's hard to iron out these mistakes in practice because you're just not in a real game situation.\"  Pennâs fortunes changed, though, after Delaware failed to convert a 39-yard field goal. Then, Robinson â shaking off a rough first drive â led a 78-yard drive full of big plays. Robinson found sophomore wide receiver Ryan Cragun for a 27-yard gain while adding a 19-yard run of his own. He capped off the drive by rolling out of the pocket and throwing a four-yard touchdown to senior wideout Kolton Huber to even the score. Delaware couldnât do anything with the ball after getting it back, as junior defensive lineman Benji Mowatt sacked Henderson to force a three-and-out. On the ensuing drive, Brooks helped lead the Quakers into enemy territory, but the Blue Hens were able to intercept Robinson to regain possession. After forcing another Delaware three-and-out, junior running back Isaiah Malcome ripped off a 46-yard run and capped off another successful series with a one-yard touchdown reception to give the Quakers their first lead of the afternoon. The Red and Blue continued their stout defensive performance throughout the first half and entered the locker room with a 14-7 lead.  Coming out of the break, Pennâs offense didnât miss a beat. Robinson lofted a deep ball over the middle to Cragun for a gain of 32 yards on the first play of the half, and he threw a 12-yard fade pass to Huber to extend the lead to 14. The Blue Hens have scored 76 of their 97 points after halftime this season, and their second-half heroics were on full display against the Quakers. Led by Henderson, the home side rattled off two straight touchdowns while keeping Penn at bay to close out the third quarter all square. In the middle of the fourth quarter, Pitts then beat his man for a 45-yard gain on the third play of a long Blue Hens drive, and Will Knight punched in a six-yard run as Delaware regained the lead.  But Penn wasn't done just yet, and got some help from its special teams down the stretch. Isaiah Malcome split two defenders on a punt return and found himself in the end zone with the Quakers ready to tie the game. With the game on the line, the Red and Blue elected to go for the two-point conversion, but Robinson threw a low incomplete pass and Penn remained behind. \"We knew it was gonna be a tough day today, so we needed to play to win,\" Priore said. \"At some point or another, we had to score more points than they did, and we felt like going for [the two-point conversion attempt] was the right decision.\" Attempting an onside kick, senior kicker Drew Brennan booted the ball out of bounds, giving the Blue Hens the opportunity to run out the clock and clinch the win.  Though the Quakers lost, the team excelled in a number of areas. Penn tallied 465 total yards of offense. Brooks added 158 yards on the ground, Robinson threw for three touchdowns, and Cragun caught eight passes for 145 yards in his collegiate debut.  \"[Cragun] did his job. He was open,\" Robinson said. \"Ryan is a great player, and last year even though he played on the scout team, we liked what we saw from him. I thought he did a great job today and translated his skills to real-game situations.\" The Red and Blue will look to rebound in another non-conference game next Saturday against Lafayette, whom they edged in their last meeting in 2013. \n",

            "It wasnât quite a buzzer beater, but it was a win over a bitter rival on Homecoming. And thatâll do. Princeton's failed 31-yard field goal attempt in the last 10 seconds secured Penn football a 38-35 victory in a fiercely fought Homecoming game that finished in fireworks. The Quakers led for almost the entire game, but for three minutes late in the fourth quarter, the hosts fell behind after the Tigers took their first lead of the contest to make it 35-31 with 4:26 left.  On the ensuing drive, Penn drove a full 80 yards down the field in nine plays that featured highlight-reel heroics from senior captain and wide receiver Justin Watson to give his team the lead and the game its final scoreline. All three of the driveâs passes were aimed at Watson with one 26-yard bomb from senior quarterback Will Fischer-Colbrie to a fading Watson saving the Quakers just as they looked stuck in front of a stout Tigers defense.  A 15-yard pass from Fischer-Colbrie to Watson, who burned his man with ease on a cut to catch the ball in the end zone untouched, secured the win for Penn.   âI think probably 80 percent of the time, I release to the outside; thatâs kind of how the play is designed, but just working with Will â¦ I knew that if I released to the inside, then weâd be on the same page,â Watson said of the play. âSure enough, I got open to the inside, and Will saw it and delivered a great ball.â After the go-ahead score, Princeton had just over a minute to put together a drive of its own, though, and threatened to send the game into overtime â or even win it in regulation. After a series of wild plays and calls that included an interception disallowed and a Princeton touchdown catch later called incomplete, the Tigers had a 31-yard field goal attempt to tie the game and send it to overtime.  Then came the ice. Then a second timeout. When the kick finally went up, it was wide right, sending Franklin Field into sheer pandemonium.  âWeâve had some classics against Princeton. There have been some phenomenal ones in my tenure here. This one here is right up there with them,â coach Ray Priore said. The win put the Quakers (4-4, 2-3 Ivy) level in the conference standings with the Tigers (5-3, 2-3). It also avenged last yearâs humiliating 28-0 defeat at Princeton in the Quakersâ worst showing in 2016.  Watson broke yet another record early on in the game on Saturday. With his third catch, the senior became Pennâs all-time leader in career receptions. He finished with eight (for 124 yards and two TDs) to take him to 265 in total.  âWould you stop it?â Priore joked to his talisman at the post-game press conference.  âI donât know what happened,â Watson said, grinning ear to ear. âThe win feels better, but itâs gonna be cool looking back on my career, for sure.â  Other stars on offense shone bright against Princeton. Running backs Abe Willows and Tre Solomon ran for 142 and 116 yards, respectively. It was the first time Penn had two rush for over 100 since 2004.  Likewise, Fischer-Colbrie came back from injury to deliver his best performance for the Red and Blue. The senior went 15-18 and threw for 202 yards and two touchdowns, giving him an astonishing quarterback rating of 214.3.  The entire offense put up 545 yards â 331 on the ground and 214 in the air. Princeton managed 448, the vast majority of which came from its passing attack. Of the Tigersâ long scoring drives, quarterback Chad Kanoff sliced open the Quakersâ secondary for a glut of mid-range completions. At times, the Tigers were ruthless.  Especially when the Quakers gave up 14 points in 90 seconds.  A botched 14-yard punt on one possession, followed by a fumble on the very first play of the next, gave Princeton remarkable field position that allowed for two easy touchdowns. Though Penn still led 24-21 at the time, it felt that the air had left the stadium â and the 9000 fans in it â altogether.  Earlier in the season, the team might have panicked itself into a loss. But Priore was pleased at the different result on Homecoming. âWe grabbed the team together at that point and told them, âJust relax. Look up at the clock and the scoreboard, see that weâre winning. Take a deep breath, and go have fun.â The last thing you can do in a panic situation is cause more chaos,â Priore said. âThey needed to take a second to get the blood pressure down, get the pulse down, and go out there and have fun. Thatâs what the kids were able to do today, and Iâm very, very proud of them.â  The result leaves Penn and Princeton tied for sixth in the Ivy League standings, but neither team is out of the title race â a scenario still exists in which all seven teams not named Brown could tie for the championship at 4-3 for the season. The Quakers and Tigers sit just one game behind four teams all tied for second, with Yale being the only remaining one-loss team in the league.  Penn takes on tied-for-second Harvard next weekend in Cambridge. If this yearâs madness in the Ancient Eight continues, then next Saturday could be yet another one for the ages. \n",

            "This season might be a disappointment to both teams thus far, but the rivalry hasnât lost any intensity. Penn football will host Princeton on Saturday as it clings to its slim Ivy League title hopes. While the Quakers (3-4, 1-3 Ivy) claimed their first Ivy win in Providence, R.I. against Brown last weekend, they do not control their destiny. They currently rank seventh behind three 3-1 teams and three 2-2 teams, including Princeton (5-2, 2-2). All three of Pennâs Ancient Eight losses saw the Red and Blue lose the lead in the last five minutes, with the losses to Dartmouth and Columbia coming on the very last play. For coach Ray Priore to get his third Ivy title in his first three years â heâs only the second Ivy coach to win in his first two years â quite a few games will need to break in Pennâs favor. Those include the last-place Brown Bears (2-5, 0-4) taking down first place Yale and Columbia. One of the prevalent storylines this year for the Quakers has been the quarterback position. Seven games into the season, it is unclear whether senior Will Fischer-Colbrie or sophomore Nick Robinson is better equipped to start under center. The former had started each of the first six games before sitting out against Brown due to injury, and could play this weekend.  Before making his first start last weekend, Robinson had appeared in four other games for Penn. However, Priore said Robinson sustained an injury in the third quarter of the Brown game and is not 100%. Robinson has completed 43 of 66 passes for 529 yards and 6 touchdowns to 1 interception, compared to 76 of 124 for 988 yards and 9 touchdowns to 5 interceptions for Fischer-Colbrie. Junior offensive lineman Tommy Dennis said that the competition between the two quarterbacks has pushed each to improve this season. âWhoever has a more consistent week of practice, thatâs who weâre going to lean on,â Dennis said. âI think weâre confident either one is in the backfield, theyâre going to make the right reads and get the job done.â The Penn defense shined again in the Brown victory and has allowed the third-fewest points in Ivy League play. Bears quarterback Nick Duncan was held to 13 of 25 passing for 89 yards, and running back David Moodie managed just 47 yards on 13 attempts. For the season, junior linebacker Nick Miller easily leads the unit in tackles with 72, and 10 players have recorded a sack for the Quaker defense that has forced 12 takeaways. Freshman running back Abe Willows got an extended look in the second half against the Bears, finishing with 59 yards on 10 attempts. Priore said this was not a case of Willows leaping ahead of senior Tre Solomon and sophomore Karekin Brooks on the depth chart, and was due in part to field conditions. âBrownâs track is a little different. Itâs a grass game and it was muddy and slippery,â Priore said. \"When Abe got on the field, he was able to put his foot on the ground and really create positive yardage. It was a nice second-half spark.â  Penn was content to grind it after senior wide receiver and captain Justin Watson scored two touchdowns in the first quarter. Watson set three school records on Saturday: most touchdown receptions with 29, most receiving yards with 3,413 and consecutive games with a touchdown reception with seven â he can tie the Ivy League record this week. His season totals now stand at 719 yards and 10 touchdowns. In last yearâs Penn-Princeton matchup, the Tigers shut out the Quakers, 28-0, in Princeton, N.J. The defeat was Pennâs first and only Ivy loss of the season, as they rebounded the next week to beat Harvard, 27-14, in a Friday night thriller at Franklin Field to force a three-way Ivy League title. While Princetonâs offense again features quarterback Chad Kanoff, who has completed 192 of 256 attempts for 2,255 yards, 19 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions, it will be missing perhaps its most dangerous weapon in quarterback/running back/wide receiver Jon Lovett. The 2016 Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year, Lovett threw for 582 yards and 10 touchdowns, ran for 411 yards and 20 touchdowns and added 235 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown. Lovett has missed the entire 2017 season after undergoing offseason surgery. Senior defensive lineman and captain Louis Vecchio says that Lovettâs absence has a limited effect on the Quakersâ defensive gameplan. âThey still do the same thing,â Vecchio said. âWe just have to be prepared to stop the play itself.â The Tigersâ offense has remained dangerous without Lovett, particularly in the passing game with its two 6-4 wide receivers, Jesper Horsted and Stephen Carlson. They have combined for 1,465 receiving yards and 16 touchdowns as they have established themselves as Kanoffâs favorite targets. Priore said the Quakers aim to slow down the pace of the game. âYou have to â¦ keep it out of their hands, control the ball and shorten the game,â Priore said. Kickoff is at 1:00 pm on Saturday at Franklin Field. Next week, the Quakers trek to Harvard before closing at home against Cornell.\n",

            "Each year, Penn Relays punctuates an otherwise stressful time on Pennâs calendar with a weekend of fun, hype, and glory at Franklin Field. The Relaysâ 124th edition did not disappoint.  Across the board of high schoolers, collegiate athletes â including scores of Quakers â and Olympians, this yearâs crop of competitors at Penn Relays made headlines in practically every event. For Penn track and field, the meet was highlighted by its first relay title since 2016 and its second since 1974.  In the womenâs 4x100-meter college championship, the Quakers found themselves up against stiff competition, including Ivy League rivals Cornell and Atlantic Coast Conference powerhouse Notre Dame. Having just missed out on the Championship of America final by finishing 10th in Thursdayâs heats, the team of senior Barbara Biney, senior Taylor McCorkle, freshman Camille Dickson, and sophomore Cecil Ene stood tall as favorites when the gun went off in the college championship.   A tight race saw no leader emerge throughout, and just two hundredths of a second separated Ene (45.42) from Notre Dameâs Kyra Lewis (45.44) at the finish line. After a momentâs deliberation, the Quakers celebrated, having won their first relay race since the menâs 4xmile in 2016. âWe were hoping to get into the first final, but when we got the top seed in the second one, we were like, âOkay, we have to win,ââ McCorkle said. âI was so proud of the team as a whole, especially Cecil, because she was the anchor, but sheâs normally a 400 runner, so I was really proud of her, too.â  The race was Pennâs highlight of the Relays, but the weekend saw a number of other historic performances by athletes in red and blue.   In the womenâs 3000-meter championship Thursday night, freshman Danielle Orie and senior Abby Hong raced to school record and second best times of 9:23.22 and 9:24.28, respectively, to finish third and fourth in the event. The pair finished just ahead of Orieâs twin sister, Gabrielle Orie of Cornell, to give the Quakers a high-flying start to the weekend.  Another third-place finish for Penn came Friday afternoon, when the womenâs shuttle hurdles squad, anchored by sophomore Elena Brown-Soler, placed third in the Championship of America, finishing just behind two powerhouse teams that ran in a separate heat. Their time of 56.43 set a new Ivy League record in the event.  But if Friday was the day for relay teams, Saturday was the day for individual Quakers to shine bright. A pair of second-place finishes on the field gave Penn a proud place in the leaderboards.  In the high jump, junior and reigning Ivy League indoor champion Anna Malizia leapt 1.78m to take second in the college championship. Later that afternoon, sophomore Sean Clarke vaulted 5.30m to take silver in the menâs pole vault championship. Penn track and field coach Steve Dolan noted that although the crowd at the Relays tends to pay more attention to the track events, his teamâs field standouts really stole the show early on Saturday.  âThey didnât quite win them, but they were hanging there right with the best,â Dolan added.  Olympic gold medalist Justin Gatlin attracted all the attention on the track Saturday afternoon. In his teamâs USA vs. the World 4x100-meter relay race, Gatlin dominated the field and won USA a championship. Afterwards, in an exclusive interview with The Daily Pennsylvanian, he expressed awe for the crowd in attendance.   â[This atmosphere] is unique,â Gatlin said. âItâs not really like measuring against a world championship crowd or an Olympic crowd â this crowd is its own. I mean, look to this community. You donât get to go to Beijing or the Olympics and see Masterâs athletes or grassroots athletes running out there as well. This is the only kind of crowd in America or in the world thatâs gonna show you really what the community of track and field really is.â All afternoon, the crowd roared for the meetâs standout athletes, though Jamaicans and Philadelphians were crowd favorites. McCorkle and sophomore Marvin Morgan received the ovations of hometown heroes when they finished fifth and sixth, respectively, in the womenâs and menâs 100-meter dash college championships.  It was a pair of impressive results for the Quakers, given the elite level of competition. National Collegiate Athletic Association perennial sprint powerhouses like Houston and Clemson fielded national champions on Saturday, making McCorkle and Morgan go all-out for their finishes as they dominated the field.  When asked why he makes sure to bring his group of elite sprinters to the Penn Relays every year, Houston sprints coach and nine-time Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis told The DP that itâs a no-brainer â the Penn Relays is one of the best meets in the world.  âItâs the biggest meet in the country every year, and itâs on NBC Television. That says it all,â Lewis said. âWe like to give our kids a chance to be in front of an incredible crowd like this, because weâre an Olympic-based program â¦ We want to put them in that kind of environment, where they can feel that energy and excitement from all across the country. Itâs always great to be back.â  The excitement continued into the evening as the meetâs final events approached. Penn fielded two strong 4x400-meter teams in the menâs college championship and the womenâs Championship of America Invitational in an effort to finish their Relays with a bang. The men finished third and the women fourth, capping off a weekend nothing short of memorable.  âWe had a lot of people involved [this weekend], but we didnât overload anybody,â Dolan said. âI think youâll see us at our best next week.â  Next week, the Quakers will stay home once again to kick off championship season by hosting the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. Though the meet may not host 50,000 in attendance like this yearâs Relays, it will likely see more of the best from Penn track. \n",

            "The menâs and womenâs track teams are sending nine athletes to Jacksonville, Fla., but not for vacation. Instead, the four men and five women heading to Florida are competing in the qualifying rounds of the NCAA Track & Field Championships, which will take place from May 24-26. The events that happen over the weekend will narrow down the field of 48 to 24 in the preliminary round and to just 12 in the quarterfinals in each event. The semi-finals and finals in each event will take place in Des Moines, Iowa, in June. Penn is sending seniors Victoria Strickland (800m), Paige Madison (400H) and Kristen Judge (high jump), and juniors Morgan Wheeler (javelin) and Jillian Hart (pole vault). âIâm excited that we have a big squad going this year,â Madison wrote in an email. âEven though itâs âindividualâ now, a big part of why weâre here is because of each other, because we challenge one another to be our best and perservere through anything and everything.â Madison is making her second career appearance at the championship meet in the 400-meter hurdles. As a sophomore, Madison finished just seven-tenths of a second short of making the quarterfinals. She is the only woman in Penn history to break 60 seconds in the event and comes to the meet seeded 25 and with a season-best mark of 59.21. âIâm very excited to have made it this far after working through so many injuries over the past couple of years,â Madison said. âIt feels like all the training and hard work weâve put in as a team has really paid off.â Strickland likewise holds a spot on Pennâs all-time list, ranking second in the 800-meters with a time of 2:06.88. Strickland was a quarter finalist in the same event at last yearâs NCAA Champs and fell just short of qualifying for the semis. Judge, seeded 43rd, earned her trip to Jacksonville with a school-record high jump performance on April 14, cleanly passing 1.75 meters. Her personal-best jump is just .03 meters off the 24th seed. For the three seniors, the weekendâs events have extra weight because, as Madison said, every race at this point âcould be [their] last date with the track.â Despite that added pressure, both she and Judge pointed out that in the flurry of end-of-year senior activities, it can be hard to stay focused. âBeing a senior, itâs harder and easier to be motivated right now,â Madison said. âItâs harder because we do have events like graduation, senior week and career planning that can easily consume us, but at the same time we must remain very disciplined on the track since we still have goals we want to accomplish.â Judge, a first-time NCAA Champs competitor, is not too concerned about the future, at least for the time being. âIâm really just trying to get my head in the meet now and keep in the present. Iâm looking forward to giving it my all and see where that takes me,â Judge said. Wheeler is also making her second appearance at the meet for the Quakers. The junior finished 35th overall at NCAAs last year and has since improved to fourth all-time at Penn in the javelin with a personal-best toss of 45.04 meters. Seeded 28th, she has the greatest chance of making the quarterfinals with only .75 meters separating her qualifying throw from the 24th seed. Hart, coming off her best collegiate season to date, is making her NCAA Champs debut in the pole vault. The 48th-seeded junior earned her place on Pennâs all-time list (2nd) and the chance to compete in NCAAs at the Penn-Princeton dual meet, winning the pole vault with a 3.85-meter effort. Representing the Quaker men are seniors Brian Fulton (800m) and Ryan Cunningham (1,500m) and sophomores Maalik Reynolds (high jump) and Jake Benza (shot put). In his second NCAA Championship appearance, Fulton is seeded 30th in the 800-meters, an event that will be among the most competitive on the weekend. The three-time All-Ivy recipient is coming into the meet hot off a career-best performance, and the seventh-best all-time at Penn (1:49.49) at the Heptagonal Championships. Cunningham qualified to compete at the meet with the second-fastest 1,500-meter time at Penn in the last 34 years at the George Mason Patriot Invitational. Though the senior is seeded 45th, his 1,500-meter time of 3:45.93, sixth on Pennâs all-time list, is only a second behind the 24th seed. Underclassmen and 39th-seeded Brenza, like his senior teammates, is within striking distance of the quarterfinals in the shot put. At Heps, he had the third-best toss in program history and the best since 1981 at 17.25 meters, which cemented his spot at NCAA Champs. Sophomore standout and fourth-seeded Reynolds has the best chance among the men of making it to Des Moines. A veteran of the national championship meet, Reynolds is already a two-time All-American and finished seventh in the outdoor championships as a freshman in 2011. He holds the sixth-best high jump in the nation at 2.24 meters, but he will face stiff competition in the top two seeds, both of whom are jumping 2.31 meters or higher. All athletes competing recognize that they will be competing against the highest caliber collegiate athletes in the country, but Judge recognized that her chance of doing well in the competition is as good as anyone elseâs. âWeâre all here for a reason, and based on my experience, all the hype of the prestige of the meet kind of melts away when it comes down to the raw competition of it. Itâs still a meet,â she said. âThe stakes are just higher.â\n",

            "Every senior hopes for a storybook ending when they get ready to compete for the last time, and thatâs just what Penn menâs swimming senior Chris Swanson got at this weekendâs NCAA National Swimming and Diving Championships.On a weekend already made historic by the number of Quakers participating at the meet, Swanson became Pennâs first ever national champion, winning the 1,650-yard freestyle in a time of 14:31.54 in incredible come-from-behind fashion.The senior started off on Thursday by picking up an 11th-place finish in the 500 free, and his time of 4:15.73 was good for a new Ivy League and Penn team record. This eclipsed his own mark of 4:16.13 which he set four weeks ago at the Ivy League Championships. Swanson also earned himself another All-American honorable mention, his first in the 500 to go with consecutive recognitions in the 1,650 in 2014 and 2015.The highlight of the weekend and of the seniorâs career came on Saturday in the finals of the mile. Entering the event, Swanson had recorded the fifth fastest time in the nation at 14:40.18, a time he swam at Ivies where he broke the Penn and meet record.Last year Swanson finished 11th at NCAAs in this distance, just short of his goal of becoming an All-American, an honor bestowed upon the top eight finishers. This year, it looked as if Swanson was destined for a second-place finish after trailing South Carolina sophomore Akaram Mahmoud for most of the race. However, Swanson closed the last 50 yards in a blisteringly fast time of 24.38, eating into Mahmoudâs lead the whole time, and touched in a time of 14:31.54, good for a school record and Pennâs first-ever national championship.âHis entire race was perfect, and he could not have gone out there and executed the race plan that we had any better,â coach Mike Schnur said. âWith 300 meters left, we didnât think he was going to catch [Mahmoud], but there is no stopping Chris at the end of the race, and it was pretty incredible to watch him pull even and win.âAccording to Swanson, something beyond just the will to win helped him through the final yards of the race.âI always know that if I look over at my teammates at the end of the race that theyâll really get me through it in the end, and thatâs what they did,â Swanson said. âThey were going wild, Iâve never seen them jump around so much.âSwansonâs time was .12 seconds faster than Mahmoudâs, the smallest margin of victory ever in the NCAA 1,650 championship. It also was the 12th fastest all-time swim in the eventâs history â only .25 seconds slower than the 11th fastest event time, set earlier this year by Clark Smith of Texas.For the final chapter in an impressive season, Penn sent six total swimmers down to Georgia Tech in Atlanta to compete in eight events at this yearâs NCAA Championships. Pennâs four individual bids was the highest among all Ivy League programs this year, and also marked the most competitors Penn has sent to the championship since 1971.Senior Eric Schultz rounded out his incredible career at Penn with three individual races in the 50, 100 and 200 freestyles. The senior swam to a 44th-place finish in the 50 with a final time of 20.11, finished 40th in the 200 in 1:37.00 and capped off the weekend with a 22nd-place finish in the 100.Pennâs underclassmen were also well represented. Sophomore Alex Peterson made his NCAA debut in the 500, 400 individual medley and 1,650, touching in 4:22.97 to place 45th in the 500, clocking a 3:48.15 for 27th place in the 400 IM and finishing 30th in the mile with a time of 15:14.42. Freshman Mark Andrew also competed in two individual events, placing 36th and 32nd in the 200 IM and 400 IM events, respectively.Andrew also combined with Schultz, freshman Thomas Dillinger and junior Kevin Su in the 400 free relay to place 23rd in a time of 2:56.07.âItâs a great experience for these guys to get to race in this atmosphere so early in their career, the same way guys like Chris have,â Schnur said. âItâs a very difficult environment, but guys like Mark and Alex are going to be back here next year, and itâs awesome that theyâve already gotten to have this opportunity to race the best guys in the country.âHowever, the weekend truly belonged to Swanson, who, despite already being considered the best swimmer in Penn history, found a way to add to his legacy.âI donât think anyone really expected those results,â Swanson said. âAs great as it is for me, it is also great for [the Penn swimming community]. Theyâre just as excited as I am, if not more.âWhile the collegiate racing season may be over for Penn, several athletes from the menâs and womenâs sides will be gearing up for the Olympic Trials in June, where swimmers like Swanson will get one last chance to go for glory.âThereâs a chance he can end up in the final heat at trials, with the chance to be one of the eight fastest guys in the country.â Schnur said. âChris is a guy who though who will swim till his heart gives out, so it will be exciting to see him get in the pool for one final time.âEven though Swanson has become the fastest collegiate mile swimmer in the country, he hesitates to depict himself as the swimming great he is.âI feel like people like the underdog, the little guy.âBut as the programâs first ever national champion, Chris Swanson is an underdog no more.\n",

            " For Penn track and field, the past weekend was the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.   After months of hard work and continuous team improvement, three of Pennâs top athletes got the chance to represent the school at collegiate track and fieldâs most elite and competitive meet: the NCAA Finals.   Those athletes were 2014 Penn graduate jumper Maalik Reynolds and rising junior throwers Sam Mattis and Kelsey Hay, all of whom advanced to the Finals    after strong performances in NCAA Regional competition.   All three made the trip out to compete in Eugene, Ore. along with various members of Pennâs coaching staff, including head coach Steve Dolan. Dolan was unable to be reached for comment at this time.   Going into the weekend, Dolan had high expectations for all three of his athletes, but especially for Reynolds and Mattis, both of whom were high qualifiers in Regionals and were expected to compete for All-American honors.   And in the end, all three athletes would deliver on their respective expectations.   Of special significance was the performance of Reynolds, the last of his storied career in the Red and Blue.   Over the past few years, Reynolds has been the undisputed face of Pennâs track and field program, consistently ranking amongst the top high jumpers in the nations and racking up enough accolades to make several premiere athletes careers.   However, Reynolds has had a relatively up-and-down year by his lofty standards, most surprisingly registering a disappointing showing at this yearâs indoor Heptagonal Championships  .   But Reynolds erased all memory of indoor Heps with a solid seventh      place, becoming a first-team All-American for the sixth time and ending his storied college career on top.   Reynoldsâ exit will undoubtedly be a huge blow to Pennâs program, but there is an exciting group of young, talented athletes who are more than ready to take his place at the helm.   Among this group of up-and-coming stars are Mattis and Hay, both of whom broke out during the season.   Mattis and Hay have led the resurgence of the Quakersâ throwing program, which was arguably the most consistent source of the teamâs relative success throughout the outdoor season after a few years    of relative obscurity.   Mattis was one of the nationâs top performers in the discus and one of the stars of the menâs squad all season, and he continued his winning ways over the weekend at the NCAA Finals.   With a monstrous toss of 60.33-meters, Mattis earned a fifth-place finish in the meetâs discus throw and the first All-American honors of his career.   Fellow rising junior Hay had a similar breakout season to Mattis in that she was arguably the womenâs most consistent top performer, but she did not go into the Finals with similar expectations.   While Mattis was a high qualifier, Hay earned the last qualifying spot in the womenâs javelin.   However, as she has done all season, she outperformed expectations, registering a 47.28m throw en route to a very encouraging 18th place overall finish. With that finish, she earned honorable mention All-American status, the first such recognition of her career.   By showcasing both the exit of the programâs top senior and national arrival of two of its top underclassmen, the NCAA Finals clearly illustrated a trend that has developed all year for Penn track and field: the rise of the programâs young athletes.   However, one of the programâs young guns was conspicuously absent from the proceedings.   Distance runner Thomas Awad was unable to qualify for Finals after falling ill during his qualifying meet. It was an unrepresentative end to what was an otherwise utterly dominant season for the rising junior.   In this respect, the Finals were a bit disappointing and the pot of gold a bit less heavy.   But it is doubtful that Dolan views the situation the same way.   Dolan has always stressed the importance of his teamâs journey, but to him, there never was a proverbial pot of gold at the end of the season.   In fact, he has already moved on from the outdoor season and made a trip overseas, supporting a select group of his athletes who will compete in Europe over the summer.   To him, the NCAA Finals were never supposed to provide any tangible payoff, but rather just another checkpoint on his young teamâs journey to greatness.   The real payoff may lay months or even years into the future, but at this rate, it looks like it will be sweet.  \n",

            " âIt would be awesome to get a big group of guys out at Nationals.â   That comment was made weeks ago by then-sophomore distance-runner Thomas Awad, just days after his historic sub-4:00 mile at the Penn Relays. And while it may not have worked out the way he would have liked for himself, his team largely came through for him.   Penn track and field sent a school record of 14 athletes down to compete in NCAA East Preliminary Round in Jacksonville, Fla. last. They did not disappoint, sending an impressive three Quakers to compete in the NCAA Finals in Eugene, Ore.   âItâs a huge step forward for us,â said coach Steve Dolan. âIt definitely gives us a positive feeling about how the spring season went.â   The menâs squad was able to build off of their breakout fourth place finish at this seasonâs Heptagonal championships with another strong overall performance.   Rising junior thrower Sam Mattis and 2014 graduate jumper Maalik Reynolds â who have stood out for the team all season â came up big for the program once again.   Mattis improved on his school record throw in the discus yet again, tossing the disc 62.13m en route to a fourth place finals-qualifying finish.   Reynolds was also able to qualify for finals, easily clearing 2.17m and placing third overall. The five-time All-American performer will look to end his stellar career with the Red and Blue on a high note.   The menâs side also put up some solid performances on the track.   Rising sophomore Nick Tuck put up an 8-second personal best in the steeplechase, and fellow rising sophomore Brendan Shearn performed well in the 10000-meter, placing 20th overall.   Unfortunately, the breakout star of the year â Awad â was not able to perform up to his high standards.   Awad ran in the 1500m, but was hampered by an inopportune illness and, thus, was unable to qualify for finals. The rising junior was also unable to run in the 5000-meter, an event for which he earned All-American honors as a freshman. It was an unrepresentative end to a season that saw him win six consecutive races at six different distances.   âWe had a lot of great performances and a lot of solid performances,â said Dolan of his team.   âObviously, Tommy [Awadâs] run was sad,â he added. âHe had an untimely sickness ... and with the quality of his season, he should be at [finals].â   On a happier note for the Quakers, the womenâs squad was also able to send a qualifier through to finals in Oregon.   Rising junior thrower Kelsey Hay put up an impressive mark of 48.89m in the javelin, good for twelfth place overall and the final spot in the NCAA finals.   Hayâs qualifying throw gives the Red and Blue two throwing qualifiers for NCAA finals (along with fellow sophomore Mattis).   This is an accomplishment that would have seemed unlikely a couple years ago, but one that is nonetheless fitting given the tremendous success of the Penn throwing program throughout the outdoor season.   âWe have a group thatâs deep, motivated, and really pushing each other,â Dolan said. âAnd weâre bringing in some good freshmen [throwers], so Iâm excited.â   Hay may not have the high expectations of Reynolds or Mattis going into finals, but Dolan is optimistic that she will be able to make some noise.   âBoth Maalik and Sam were very strong qualifiers,â Dolan said. âHay is not one of the higher seeds ... but the field is very closely bunched. So I feel good about all the qualifiers.â   Also notable for the Penn women was 2014 graduate Gabrielle Pipersâ performance in the 100m hurdles, the last run of her successful career with the Red and Blue.   âFor her to qualify for NCAAs in her last season ... was fun to see,â Dolan said. âAnd she leaves here as one of the top hurdlers in school history.â   In the next two weeks, Dolan and his staff will focus on preparing Pennâs three qualifiers for competition in Oregon.   The rest of Pennâs athletes will get the next few weeks to recover. But as Dolan is quick to point out, rest doesnât come for long for a varsity track and field athlete, and it wonât be long until the Quakers head across the Atlantic to compete in the UK later this month.  \n",

            "With athletes competing in the Tennessee Relays, Bucknellâs Bison Classic, and the Rider Invite, Penn track stayed busy this weekend. When all was said and done, Penn took home 10 victories, and 10 of its performances secured spots in the top 10 all-time for their respective events. The women's team broke several records across all three competitions. At the Tennessee Relays, the group set two program records while making strides in three others. In the 4x400-meter relay, sophomore Uchechi Nwogwugwu and juniors Elena Brown-Soler, Cecil Ene, and Nia Akins set the third-best time in program history.  In the field events, Brown-Soler continued to put her name into the record books by taking the fourth all-time slot in the long jump, with junior Kathryn Schoenauer moving into the ninth-best position all time. The women finished out the field program with an additional five athletes placing in the top 10 of their events. Penn's biggest accomplishments in Tennessee were the record-breaking runs of Akins in the 800 and Ene in the 200, who set new times of 2:03.76 and 23.63, respectively. âI donât think weâve changed anything, which I think has been really helpful. Honestly, the thing thatâs changed has been the racing aspect of it and building confidence over time,â Akins saidâWe worked more on endurance in the offseason, and now we are beginning to focus more on speed. Itâs helped me to feel more confident in my fitness, but at the same time it has forced me to manage my expectations and mindset towards competition,â Ene said. âIf you execute your race properly, the time will come. When I see a good time, I am always happy, but I feel itâs more beneficial to focus on what I could improve on and never be complacent.â  The women picked up yet another record during the Bison Classic on Saturday with junior Maddie Villalbaâs run of 4:16.83 in the 1500, outpacing the previous program record by 1.12 seconds. The Quakers rounded out their hectic weekend with a few victories at the Rider Invite. Freshman athletes made their presence known in this competition, with Mia Knight conquering the 100m dash, Haley Rizek securing the javelin win, and Skyla Wilson delivering the seventh-best 100m hurdle time in Penn history. Junior Zoe Early also came away with a victory in the pole vault with a mark of 3.55m. While menâs track was unable to set new program records, the team still had a strong showing this weekend. In the Tennessee Relays field events, the freshmen continued to dominate with Marc Minichello, whose 72.45m javelin throw gave him the third-best spot in Penn history. Junior Nathan Fisherâs performance in the pole vault was the fourth-best all-time mark, and sophomore Cristian Constantin's triple jump secured the sixth all-time mark in program history. The men acquired most of their victories at the Rider Invite due to their formidable display in the field events. Sophomore Campbell Parker was on double duty and failed to disappoint, winning in both the discus and hammer throw. With a mark of 7.12m, sophomore Demetri Whitsett snatched the long jump victory, and junior Sean Clarke triumphed in the pole vault. The placement of several Quakers in NCAA East record spots was a highlight of this weekendâs competitions. Minchelloâs javelin throw put him at the seventh-best spot on the NCAA East list this season, and Villalbaâs run in the 1500 at the Bison Classic is the fourth-best time in the NCAA East. Akinsâ time in the 800 moved her into second on the NCAA East qualifying list. âMy whole team follows the same mindset. Now weâre in a position where weâre doing really well as a group, and I just try to piggy-back off of them and feed off their energy and do the best,â Akins said. Now that invitationals season is almost over, the Red and Blue have their eyes on several pivotal competitions. After next weekâs Larry Ellis Invitational at Princeton, the Quakers will head back home to the Penn Relays before gearing up for the Ivy League Outdoor Heptagonal Championships.\n",

            "Track and fieldâs indoor season may be one of the shortest in college sports, but itâs nearing a dramatic finish as Penn prepares for the Ivy League Heptagonal Indoor Championships this weekend.The leagueâs championship meet will take place at the Armory Track in New York City, one of the nationâs most famous indoor venues. For some athletes on the team, the thought of competing at the Armory is something to look forward to.Senior Chris Hatler, for example, has been competing at the Armory for years. And just a couple weeks ago, the distance runner shattered a career milestone â the sub-four minute mile.âIâve been running at the Armory since I was 16 years old, so to be able to go back and accomplish one of my lifetime goals was something that was pretty incredible,â Hatler said. âItâs something that every miler works for, the magical sub-four mile.âBut Columbiaâs indoor arena isnât just a home for Hatler. Sophomore thrower Rachel Wilson is also looking forward to Heps because of the competition and its location.âItâs a really exciting time,â she said. âEspecially since itâs gonna be at the Armory, itâll be really loud and noisy, so exciting with so many things going on at once.âWilson is seeded No. 2 in the weight throw, an event she broke Pennâs all-time record for earlier this year. Similarly, Penn rookie Maura Kimmel also holds the No. 2 seed in the womenâs shot put. The freshman also broke the school record for her event earlier in the season â and has since broken her own record multiple times.On the menâs side of the throwers, senior Noah Kennedy-White has had a resurgence at the tail end of the season after a slow start. No longer in the shadow of graduated NCAA champion Sam Mattis, Kennedy-White has worked his way up to a fourth seed in the shot put, currently just under two meters outside of second place.If the throwers can carry their weight on Saturday and Sunday, things could look optimistic as the runners take the track.With Hatler and senior Ashley Montgomery leading the distance squads that did well in the cross country season this fall, Penn will be sure to pick up points at the longer-distance events. In particular, the men ought to rack up points in the 5000-meter run, where Brendan Shearn and Christopher Luciano pack a two-three punch in the seedings.âThe main goal for us is at Heps to see how high we can score,â Hatler said. âItâs gonna be kind of hard to try and beat well-established teams such as Princeton and Cornell who have a lot more depth than we do across the board....Weâre thinking that weâre gonna be scrappy, and weâre going to try to get third.âPrinceton and Cornell have been the top dogs for a number of years now, as Penn has had to settle for third. But with new freshmen to add to the teamâs depth, the Quakers could try to close the gap on the top two this weekend.In the shorter-distance events on the track, two names lead the headlines for the Red and Blue. For the women, junior Taylor McCorkle has been racking up the plaudits, earning top-three seeds in the 60m and 200m dashes. McCorkle, paired with 60m hurdle rookie Breanne Bygrave, who already broke the Ivy League record just a month into her career, ensure that Pennâs women will pick up valuable points on the track.âThis appears to be one of the strongest [womenâs] teams in recent history,â coach Steve Dolan said.The other star sprinter for the Red and Blue is sophomore Calvary Rogers. Last year as a freshman, Rogers took second in a tightly-contested 200m dash. This year, he enters Heps at the No. 3 seed, but almost every other top-10 seeded runner earned his spot at a particularly fast race in Boston two weekends ago. Rogers will have a chip on his shoulder as he dukes it out for the 200m title on Sunday.All the stars will have to align if Penn wants to usurp Princeton and Cornell at the Ivy League championships this weekend, but at the very least, the championship meet should bring a dramatic conclusion to the indoor season and give the Quakers a springboard into the spring season in a few weeksâ time.\n",

            "Penn womenâs track and field returned to the Ivy League throne on Sunday after a 22-year drought, winning the Ivy League Indoor Heptagonal Championships to end the indoor track and field season. The men made history of their own, posting a momentous second-place finish, their highest since 2002. For the first time since 1996, womenâs track and field placed first at Heps, and in dominating fashion, setting a program record of 137 points. Harvard, who won this meet for the past five years, came in second with 105 points. Additionally, the Penn women procured six individual championships over the two-day meet held at Dartmouth. It was the programâs most individual wins since 1988. Coach Steve Dolan noted that it was one of the most sensational weekends of his career.  âComing in, we thought we had a chance,\" he said. \"It was exciting to actually watch, though, as we performed exceptionally across the board.â Senior captain Abby Hong had the performance of a lifetime in her two distance events, winning two of Penn's six individual titles. She captured Pennâs first individual championship since 2012 in the 3,000-meter run on Saturday, posting a time of 9:38.98 â almost five seconds ahead of the second-place finisher. Hong followed up on Sunday with another individual championship in the 5,000m, crushing the school record by over four seconds with a final time of 16:24.46. âThere is something about the atmosphere of Heps, and knowing that we are all competing for something greater than ourselves that allows for such special performances,â Hong said. Freshman Uchechi Nwogwugwu swiped gold in the 500m for the first time in program history. Nwogwugwu finished with a time of 1:13.09. Notably, it was her first time all season racing that distance. Teammate Candace Taylor also placed, finishing third with a time of 1:14.66. Beyond individual running performances, the 4x800m relay quartet of Gina Alm, Mikayla Schneider, Nia Akins, and anchor Katie DeVore not only took first place, but demolished the competition by nearly three seconds, finishing in 8:47.87. The Quakers also had a pair individual championships on the field, both in events that they had never won at Heps. Junior Rachel Lee Wilson earned a gold in the weight throw, throwing for a distance of 18.7m. In the high jump, junior Anna Peyton Malizia set a new school record and took first by leaping 1.80m. In addition to the six first-place finishes, the championship was earned through a deep all-team effort. Many Quakers scored high for their team with second or third-place finishes. Notably, sophomore Maddie Villalba took second in the mile with personal best of 4:49.26. Sophomore Breanne Bygrave placed second in the 60m hurdles with a time of 8.55 seconds. Senior Taylor McCorkle sprinted for silver in the 60m with a time of 7.49.  In the 400m, Penn had three runners score: rookie Caroline OâNeil in second, sophomore Cecil Ene in third, and freshman Camille Dickson in sixth. Sophomore Maura Kimmel placed second in the shot put with a strong 15m toss. Molly Minnig took silver for the second straight year on pole vault with a mark of 3.95m. The men's performance was almost as historic, as their second-place finish was their best in 16 years.  Junior sprinter Calvary Rogers outlasted the competition and took gold in the 200m for the second year in a row, tying his own meet record with a time of 21.39. The two-peat was special enough to make up for the fact that last year, he won the event in spectacular fashion, racing alone in a heat of one.  In the heptathlon, sophomore Evan Lee took silver with a total score of 5,330 points. The score ranks third in program history. Freshman Marvin Morgan performed like an upperclassman in his 60m dash, placing second with a time of 6.86 seconds. Sophomore sensation Sean Clarke placed second in the pole vault after tying with Princetonâs August Kiles, resulting in a jump-off. Clarke cleared 5.25m, but could not match Kilesâ 5.3m jump. Dolan was impressed with the menâs finish. âMoving up to second place was a great step forward for the program. Iâm proud of the individual performances and team effort from everyone this weekend,â he said. âThe diversity of the events is what makes track and field interesting. Both Penn teams proved that they have a strong balance throughout the events, and that is was what made the difference today.â\n",

            "           For the members of Penn menâs swimming, this weekendâs Ivy League Championships will take on a variety of meanings. For some, it represents an opportunity to make an impression. Others see it as a way to cement a legacy.In both cases, the year-end tournament at Brown will cap one of the Quakersâ most successful seasons in recent memory. Captained by seniors Chris Swanson and Eric Schultz, the team won nine of its dual and tri-meets and only lost to Ivy opponents Harvard and Princeton. Along with its impressive record, Penn achieved an all-time high national rank of No. 24 in the College Swimming Coaches Association of America poll and reached a peak position of 13th in College Swimmingâs annual mid-year rankings.  The teamâs overall success can be traced to stellar individual efforts displayed throughout the season. Swanson and Schultz were nothing short of dominant, vanquishing the field nearly every time they entered the water in their respective freestyle races. The pair added to their extensive collection of school records, bringing the total to 11 between them.  Swanson once again proved his distance prowess, recording a personal-best and school record time of 14:41.54 in the 1,650-yard freestyle in addition to breaking a 36-year-old Sheerr Pool record in the 1,000 free, set by Olympic silver medalist Bobby Hackett.  Schultz, who supplemented his teammateâs endurance with his elite speed, broke Pennâs all-time mark in the 100 free with a time of 42.83 and served as an anchor for the fastest 800 free relay swim in school history at the Total Performance Invitational hosted by Kenyon College in December.  Given their illustrious careers, Schultz and Swanson would be excused if they felt some nostalgia entering their final Ivy Championships.  For these seniors, however, the opposite is true, as the duo is highly focused on emerging victorious both individually and collectively as a team.  âIâm not really thinking about this as an end of my career or anything,â Swanson said. âJust trying to go in and do what Iâve done every year and to try and score as many points for the team as I can. Iâm really not thinking about what Iâm going to do afterwards or that this is the last one.â  After a fourth-place finish at Ivies last year with a team score of 1,042.5 points, the Red and Blue will look to challenge the supremacy of Harvard and Princeton, who are dually responsible for the last 23 Ivy Championships. Swanson and Schultz carried the load last year, with Swanson racking up three wins, including a Ivy League record in the 1,000 free. Schultz contributed a championship of his own in the 200 free by swimming a school-best 1:34:80.  This year, however, the seasoned veterans should have significantly more help. Freshmen Thomas Dillinger and Mark Andrew have had exceptional starts to their careers for the Quakers, with several first- and second-place finishes against quality competition in the individual medley and sprint freestyle events. Andrew submitted one of the most surprising performances of the season at the Total Performance Invitational, setting a school record in the 400 IM. Dillinger has particularly impressed as of late, including a victory in the 200 IM at the Harvard-Brown tri-meet.Because of these accomplishments, coach Mike Schnur has no concerns about the youngstersâ ability to handle the pressure of their first collegiate championships.âBoth Thomas and Mark have experience in national-level meets. This summer, both Mark and Thomas made finals in the 200 IM at Junior Nationals,â Schnur said. âMark was second and Thomas was fourth. Thatâs pressure. Both of those guys have been in this kind of situation.âThese two dynamic duos will look to try to bring Penn its first Ivy crown since 1971 and ensure that this season will be one for the history books.\n",

            "For the second consecutive weekend, Penn track and field will host a meet at Franklin Field, with Saturdayâs Penn Challenge against Army, Manhattan, Rider, Villanova and Connecticut just days away.While there will be some similarities between the Penn Challenge and last weekendâs Philadelphia College Classic, sophomore Jeff Wiseman sees is a key difference in the level of competition.âThe competition is a lot stronger,â he said. âThere are fewer teams, but the teams coming are bringing their best competitors.âIn the Philadelphia College Classic, where Penn officially opened its outdoor season against Philadelphia-area schools, the men recorded victories in six events. Senior Sam Mattis made headlines in the discus with his distance of 67.45 meters becoming the current best mark in the world, surpassing the International Association of Athletic Federations Olympic A Standard and setting new school and conference records as well as placing the senior captain fourth in NCAA history. At the NCAA Championships last June, Mattis won with a throw of 62.48 meters.Mattis picked up a second win in the shot put and sophomore Sean Ryan won Penn a third field event with a 57.21-meter mark in the hammer throw. Junior Nick Tuck and the Quakers took the top three spots in the steeplechase, with Tuck leading the way with a mark of 5:49.07. The other two Penn wins came from sophomore Patrick Hally and junior Chris Hatler, who took down the 1,500 meter run and 3,000 meter run with times of 3:51.44 and 8:23.37, respectively.On the womenâs side, two freshmen collected their first wins of the outdoor season in Marin Warner and Nicole Macco. Warner won the 1,500-meter run in 4:43.71 while Macco secured the pole vault with a 3.5-meter mark. The Quakersâ two other track wins came from juniors Ella Wurth and Ashley Montgomery, who claimed the 800-meter and 3K runs with times of 2:12.91 and 9:31.25, respectively.Junior Nailah Hill triumphed in the discus with a throw of 45.06 meters, and senior Kelsey Hayâs 47.43 mark in the javelin was good for first place as well. Last Saturday was Hayâs second meet of the spring season after she, Mattis and junior Noah Kennedy-White competed in the USF Invitational the weekend prior.âThat was nice for us since weâve been dormant over the last couple of preseasons and weâre long throwers, where there is no equivalent indoors,â Hay said. âIt was really nice to have that opening meet, just a shake-out-the-cobwebs meet. All of us ended up exceeding our expectations.âWith the goal of being at their best from Heps through the remainder of the season, the Quakers have been training since indoor season. As the outdoor season blooms, these first few meets will be used for evaluating injuries and getting used to being outdoors again. Sophomore Taylor McCorkle said that after the buildup and last weekendâs rough weather, she is excited for the next few months â with hopefully nicer weather conditions.âCoach [Porscha] Dobson tells us at indoor that weâre not expected to peak because we definitely want to keep progressing and get faster for outdoors,â McCorkle said, adding that the team has seen some encouraging times from indoor season. âI think weâre ready to open up, get warm weather and run fast.âMcCorkle also spoke of competing in a less stressful environment when at her home track, an emphasis Penn coach Steve Dolan shares.âItâs the second meet at home, and we love competing at home,â Dolan said. âAs a team at large, weâre going to give a bigger effort in the second meet as far as people in their primary events being ready to go.âDolan also provided an update to the status of senior Thomas Awad, who did not race last weekend after placing third in the NCAA Mile Finals on March 12. He said Awad will definitely be in action next weekend at the Stanford Invitational but is unsure of whether Awad will race this weekend.\n",

            "A recent study conducted by a group of Penn researchers revealed that a specific combination of a protein and immune cells could shrink cancerous tumors. School of Medicine postdoctoral fellow Chrystal Paulos and professor Carl June recently published a study in the Science Translational Medicine journal. In it, they reported that when a cell, Th17, was stimulated with a particular protein, it shrank human tumors implanted in a mouse model. Human immune cell Th17 is known to help the body fight infection. However, excessive amounts of the cell have been linked to such diseases as multiple sclerosis and Crohnâs disease. The key to developing a new way to treat cancer or any other autoimmune disease is to use Th17âs disease-fighting capability while leaving its disease-causing aspects inactivated, according to the study. In this case, the protein ICOS stimulates Th17 to expand the immune cells to large numbers so they can fight cancerous cells. Paulos and June plan to use their findings to develop new ways of conducting adoptive T-cell transfer therapy, a therapy for cancer patients in which immune cells are extracted from the patient, expanded in a laboratory and engineered with a certain molecule that would allow them to kill cancer cells when injected back into the patientâs body. Paulos explained that one could âpolarizeâ immune cells, also known as T-cells, grown with the protein ICOS using bioengineering techniques to direct an immune response to attack specific tumor cells. âThis can become broader,â she said. âTheoretically, we can make any tumor-specific T-cell to kill any kind of tumor.â Penn Med staff scientist and co-author of the study Carmine Carpenito called these findings a foray into âboutique science,â or personalized medicine in which one could engineer T-cells to target any cancer, specific to any individual. âFor example, you could obtain tumor-specific tissue of ovarian cancer, genetically engineer a T-cell immune response and put that back into the patientâs body to fight the cancer,â he said. According to Carpenito, the key to developing a diverse immune response that can attack any cancer cell is investigating the ICOS protein. Previous studies often used a different protein, CD28, to stimulate the growth of Th17 immune cells. The results of this study came as a surprise in translational medicine, as ICOS was identified as having a stronger response in its ability to grow and target cancerous tumors. Immunotherapy options, like the ones the Penn study aims to develop, are a growing treatment option in cancer medicine. Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration introduced its first immunotherapy treatment by approving Provenge, a treatment geared toward advanced prostate cancer in men. Provenge operates much like the treatment Paulos and June hope to develop. According to an FDA press release, each dose of Provenge is made by obtaining a patientâs immune cells from his blood. The immune cells are then exposed to a protein found in most prostate cancers. The patientâs own cells are returned to his body to treat the cancer. After the approval of Provenge, the FDA began looking into immunotherapy applications not only for cancer, but also for asthma and allergies. Paulos and Carpenito are now enrolling participants for clinical trial testing in which their findings will be tested on a small group of individuals, probably those suffering from ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, a condition most commonly brought on by interactions with asbestos. Both researchers hope to develop their findings into a practical future treatment for patients. âOur study just became its own monster and grew and grew,â Carpenito said. âHopefully itâll keep growing.â\n",

            "The cure for cancer remains unknown, but researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine may have developed a way to stop one kind of cancer in its tracks. The study, led by Brian Czerniecki, Co-Director of the Rena Rowan Breast Center and Surgical Director of the Immunotherapy Program for the Abramson Cancer Center, found that giving women with early stages of ductal carcinoma in situ â a type of breast cancer â a four-week vaccine regimen resulted in a dramatic improvement of symptoms for 85 percent of test subjects. The vaccines also successfully eradicated cancer cells in 20 percent of participants. The study was performed on 27 women with HER2-positive DCIS. DCIS is a form of early breast cancer. Results from this study can be applied to breast cancer prevention and treatment, Czerniecki wrote in an email. Lynn Ayre, Director of Cancer Research at the American Cancer Society, is optimistic about the results of Czernieckiâs study. âThereâs much vaccine activity going on in the medical community,â she said. âSome say a breast cancer vaccine will be here in our lifetime.â Furthermore, the use of vaccines could reduce the need for surgery and radiation, Czerniecki wrote. The vaccines are made from a combination of anti-HER2 dendritic cells and the patientsâ own white blood cells. âDr. Czerniecki is trying to train the bodyâs immune system to react to cancer cells the same way itâd react to infection,â Ayres said. The hope is that the vaccines would cause the body to fight cancer cells itself, she added. Using vaccines as a potential treatment for cancer is a new area of cancer research. âThis vaccine will be personalized for the patient,â Ayres said. âIn the future, treatments will be much more personalized.â Czerniecki does not see any potential ethical problems with this treatment and concludes from his research that the vaccine regimen is feasible. Ayres said using vaccines to cure cancer is less invasive, would have fewer side effects and would probably be a less toxic alternative for cancer patients. Furthermore, she cited Kent State Universityâs Gary Koski â a collaborator on the study â in saying that vaccine treatments would be more cost-effective. The vaccine is still seeking FDA approval and Czerniecki needs to expand his study to include more participants, Ayres said. She added that the research will eventually extend into treating invasive forms of breast cancer. However, the studyâs eighty-five percent success rate is âfantastic,â and âwe can expect a cure to DCIS in five years,â she said. âIt opens the possibility of either preventing recurrence of breast cancer or primary prevention of estrogen independent breast cancer,â Czerniecki wrote. But Ayres has even higher hopes for this research. âThis vaccine could also help other kinds of cancer, not just breast cancer,â she said. In addition, the results of the study may also have a positive impact on philanthropic causes toward breast cancer research. College junior Alexis Mayer, who is planning a breast cancer awareness event in March, said this study could result in more people giving to charitable organizations, especially ones that support women with DCIS. âIn general people are more likely to give to causes that could be successful,â she said. âPeople like positive results.â\n",

            "After the Campus Conversation highlighted several concerns related to mental wellness within the Penn community, Penn President Amy Gutmann announced in an email that Penn would undertake a series of steps to evaluate and improve mental health â including an administrative review of Counseling and Psychological Services.  Two months after the announcement, a team of management experts from Penn Medicine has finished collecting data on the general operations of CAPS for the report. The data, however, is not yet available, and officials from CAPS said they are not sure when it will be released. The Penn Medicine team has collected data on CAPS operations through interviews with staff members, patients, Penn students, and other Philadelphia residents. The cumulative report will include information on treatment frequency and wait time, scheduling processes, and staff workload. âItâs a review sort of on the machinery of CAPS,â CAPS Director of Outreach and Prevention Meeta Kumar said. âThey are looking at how efficient we are and how well weâre working.â  The review will address past CAPS complaints from students about lengthy wait times, which CAPS Director Bill Alexander said is still a problem because of the rising number of students visiting CAPS each month.  In September 2017, 250 more students visited the center than in September 2016. Overall, CAPS had 1,000 more sessions in September 2017 than in September 2016. Alexander said that was \"a huge increase to get hit with.\" Kumar said that the average wait time this year is seven to 10 days, although in the past students have reported waiting three and a half weeks for a non-crisis CAPS appointment. âWe can understand that to all students their needs seem urgent. But to get everyone in as quickly as possible, with the growing demand, thatâs difficult,â Kumar said. âWe are trying to figure out how to best meet the increased demand.â Alexander said that CAPS does not plan on adding more patients per therapist, each of whom already sees 25 to 27 clients every week.  Although this report is still pending, Alexanderâs goal for this semester is to implement a smoother referral process. Approximately 15 percent of all students who visit CAPS are referred to an outside provider, but no formal referral system has been put in place to streamline the information given to students. As a result, students are often unaware that CAPS does not traditionally offer long-term treatment and can sometimes only be alerted to that midway or toward the end of their treatment at CAPS. The report follows Penn's launch of a new wellness website intended to consolidate the University's resources.  Penn Benjamins Director of External Affairs and Wharton senior Phillip Isom said other wellness resources not assessed in the review, particularly student-led groups like Reach-a-Peer Helpline, may be underutilized. âThe people who need a professional medical doctor really need CAPS, but CAPS ends up with a lot of people who just need stress management and peer listening. Thereâs a difference,â Isom said. âItâs all related to students and CAPS not being 100 percent on the same page on what services are offered.â\n",

            "After receiving recent approval from the National Institutes of Health, researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine will move forward with the first-ever human trials using CRISPR gene therapy technologies.CRISPR are segments of prokaryotic DNA containing short repetitions of base sequences. With the ability to easily change DNA, scientists could theoretically slow the aging process and lengthen lives, bring back extinct species and feed the world by changing genes in farm crops so they can grow in different places, according to CNN.The revolutionary CRISPR gene therapy technology was initially discovered in bacterium by a group of Japanese scientists and quickly took the gene therapy stage by storm. Although numerous other technologies relating to gene therapy have been developed and are currently undergoing investigation, CRISPR revolutionized genetics by becoming the first of its kind of âgenome editorâ with innate specificity due to a guide-RNA.Despite its potential, not all gene therapies have progressed, due to some controversy. Since the case of Jesse Gelsinger, who suffered from an X-linked genetic disease of the liver and died as a result of misuse of gene therapy techniques at Penn in 1999, gene techniques such as CRISPR are met with apprehension.Deaths and other maladies around the United States that are related to gene therapies have also produced numerous skeptics regarding the efficacy of the technique.According to Dr. Tobias Raabe, the adjunct associate professor and principal investigator of the Penn Gene Targeting Core and Laboratory, gene therapy technologies could be the future of genetics despite the ongoing debate surrounding them.âI have no doubt that gene therapy will become extremely important in the future,â Raabe said. âEven though I am fully aware of the danger of potential off-target effects in gene therapy, very promising novel technologies, including exciting CRISPR-based methods, are currently being developed in academia and in industry to make gene therapy safer.âAccording to TIME, CRISPR is considered one of the greatest recent breakthroughs in science.If the study is approved by the organization that will conduct it, Penn scientists involved in the trial will test the mechanisms behind CRISPR by removing immune cells from 18 select patients afflicted with melanoma, sarcoma and myeloma.After genome editing, these immune cells will then be injected back into patients. Phase 1 of the CRISPR genome-editing project will focus on the safety of the procedure as well as its efficacy in treating certain cancers.The trial will be funded by a cancer organization founded by former Facebook president Sean Parker. According to the medical news site STAT, phase one will take place at MD Anderson Cancer Center and the University of California, San Francisco, in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine.\n",

            "Pennâs Center for Personalized Diagnostics uses cutting-edge, genome-wide tests to see the rare mutations even high-power microscopes cannot detect. The CPDâ a joint venture between the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the Abramson Cancer Center âbegan testing for patients on Feb. 14. It integrates Molecular Genetics, Pathology Informatics and Genomic Pathology, and uses cutting-edge, genome-wide tests to see the rare mutations even high-power microscopes cannot detect. âOn a day to day basis, we receive tumor specimens that the pathologists have already reviewed and â¦ we extract the DNA from the samples we receive,â Robert Daber, the Technical Director of Clinical Genomics at the Center for Personalized Diagnostics said. âWe then sequence a large number of genes from the genome and look for mutations that are present in the tumor specimens that then help the clinicians understand how to treat their patients better.â David Roth, chair of the department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, joined Penn almost two years ago and created CPD in close collaboration with Chi Dang of the Abramson Cancer Center. âThis technology, called massively parallel sequencing, or ânext generation sequencing,â allows us, for the first time, to determine the nucleotide sequences of many genes simultaneously,â he said in an email. âIn our first few weeks of applying these tests, called cancer gene panels, we have already found mutations in samples from several patients that are very rare in those particular cancers, and would not have been looked for using single gene tests.â Since CPD began operating two months ago, tests in 80 percent of patients revealed genetic mutations â findings that allow for more efficient treatment options. The center currently focuses on four disease areas â acute myeloid leukemia, brain tumors, lung tumors and melanoma â but plans to expand tests to other diseases in the near future. Director of the Leukemia Program at the Abramson Cancer Center Selina Luger explained that most patients with AML receive a standard treatment of induction chemotherapy to treat the disease. Once patients are in remission, they are given more chemotherapy to prevent the disease from returning. Cytogenetics â which looks at the DNA of chromosomes â was discovered at Penn more than 50 years ago. However, this analysis does not detect abnormalities in the majority of patients. âSo the question is: is there a way to identify abnormalities in those patients with normal chromosomes? And thatâs what the Center for Personalized Diagnostics is doing for us,â Luger said. âSo far weâve looked at about 30 patients with acute leukemia and 95 percent of them have had genetic abnormalities identified that were not done by traditional tests.â She explained that the goal is to develop novel therapies that are less toxic and allow for treatment without the side effects that result from chemotherapy. In addition to this goal, CPD is currently working on gene panel based tests that will hopefully be able to detect a variety of cancers via a simple blood test, according to Roth. âIt is thrilling for us to be able to offer new hope to patients.  Our entire team is very gratified by our early experience. This is working out even better than we had hoped,â he said.\n",

            "Pennâs School of Medicine is one of 22 institutions nationwide participating in a clinical trial for a procedure that may offer high-risk heart patients a safer alternative to open-heart surgery. The PARTNER Trial, which stands for Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves, tests an alternative procedure for patients with severe aortic stenosis, called transcatheter aeortic valve implantation, or TAVI. In patients with the disease, the aortic valve is âblocked with calcium, and the heart needs to work harder to eject blood through the valve to the rest of the body,â according to Howard Herrmann, director of cardiac catheterization at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and one of the heads of the Penn trial. Herrmann explained that traditional treatment for the disease is open-heart surgery, during which patients are put on a heart-lung bypass machine while surgeons take out the old valve and put a new one in its place. Open-heart surgery, however, poses a higher risk for patients with severe aortic stenosis. The TAVI procedure, which is less invasive than its traditional counterpart, uses a device created by study sponsor Edwards Lifesciences. In a catheter-based process, doctors implant a new valve inside the old one through an artery in the leg or groin. The trial is divided into two portions. The first began in November 2007 and ended this spring, with its results recently published in this weekâs print issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Herrmann said the first part of the trial studied the TAVI procedure in patients who are âtoo old or too sick for open-heart surgery.â The second portion, which is currently being conducted and anticipated to be completed by the end of the year, compares the new therapy to traditional open-heart surgery âin high-risk, but not prohibitive-risk patients,â he said. The device, known as the SAPIEN valve, has already been approved in Europe. According to Herrmann, the standard for approval in Europe measures safety, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration measures both safety and efficacy. The device must, therefore, prove to be âas good as or better than another therapy,â he said. This âcumbersomeâ approval process, noted Joseph Bavaria, vice chief of Penn Medâs Division of Cardiovascular Surgery and co-leader of the Penn trial, contributes to why the United States has not yet adapted the procedure. The PARTNER trial is unique in that it calls for a âmultidisciplinary team,â according to Herrmann. Generally, âif you need a stent,â a tube inserted into a blood vessel to improve blood flow, âyou go to an interventional cardiologist. If you need heart surgery you go to a surgeon,â he said. âThis is a novel procedure and novel approach where both of our skill sets are utilized,â he added. Herrmann and Bavaria have operated together on over 100 patients since the start of the trial in November 2007, and over 100 more are still on the waitlist. Bavaria said the TAVI procedure will likely open up new treatment options for those high-risk or inoperable patients, estimating that 35,000 to 50,000 people, who would not otherwise receive the valve implantation, will benefit from the procedure once it is approved. âItâs life saving,â he said.\n",

            "A new blood test for appendicitis under trial at the School of Medicine could eventually replace costly and harmful radiation scans for patients needing immediate diagnoses for abdominal pain. âAbdominal pain is the most common reason why people come to the emergency department,â said Angela Mills, assistant professor of emergency medicine and the leader of the study at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania site, which has approximately 100 of the studyâs 800 patients. She added that actual causes of the pain can range from benign sources to life-threatening ones requiring immediate operations, but physicians rely heavily on testing for diagnosis. âWeâre always looking to decrease some of that testing,â Mills said. Her study examines whether a simple blood test could potentially replace a CT scan â a costly procedure that uses X-ray imaging to produce cross-sectional images of the body. While a CT scan is a powerful radiology tool that can diagnose different causes of abdominal pain, it also delivers low doses of ionizing radiation, which is known to increase a patientâs risk of cancer through repeated or large amounts of exposure. According to Mills, undergoing a CT scan once or twice may not be a problem, but emergency rooms may not always have full information on whether a patient has received one recently. In addition, CT scans take four to five hours to produce results. Mills cited a culture of over-testing as a possible explanation for the increase in CT scan usage. âWith media and education, patients have started to expect a CT scan â¦ they think testing more is better, but theyâre not aware of the risks.â Physicians are also likely to rely on the scans because âtheyâre so readily available, not to mention the medical and legal pressures to produce a concrete diagnosis from testing,â she said. Studies such as Millsâ, however, demonstrate that âpeople are starting to think about using testing in a judicial way,â she said. If the study shows that this blood test can accurately diagnose appendicitis, the next step would be to conduct a clinical trial with a rapid blood test that could be conducted at a patientâs bedside, according to Mills. With such a procedure, patients could receive test results in fifteen minutes, she said. The test requires approval from the Food and Drug Administration before it can be used in hospitals. âItâs hard to guess when, but this blood test probably wonât be in use for at least a few years,â Mills said.\n",

            "Penn Medicine and researchers at the Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia successfully treated a deadly lung disease in a mouse using the applied gene editing technique CRISPR, Penn Medicine News reported.  Penn Medicine researchers led several experiments involving gene editing in mice, which utilized the genetic engineering technology CRISPR. The research study, published April 17 in Science Translational Medicine, marks a potential breakthrough for a new therapy that can be potentially used to treat common lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, that are diagnosed in utero, Penn Today reported.  Edward Morrisey, professor of cardiovascular medicine and cell and developmental biology at the Perelman School of Medicine, along with William Peranteau, professor of surgery at the Medical School, conducted the experiments in gene editing. The use of CRISPR resulted in a survival rate of 22% for mice born with a mutation causing lung disease, which previously killed all mice.  âThe ability to cure or mitigate a disease via gene editing in mid-to late gestation before birth and the onset of irreversible pathology is very exciting,â Peranteau told Penn Medicine News. âThis is particularly true for diseases that affect the lungs, whose function becomes dramatically more important at the time of birth.â  The scientists injected mice with the fatal lung disease with the gene editors late in gestation and found distinct changes in the quality of their lungs. The application of gene editors was applied in similar conditions to mice with a defect that resulted in a lung disease that causes death within hours of birth. Gene editing resulted in increased lung health and survival.  Penn Med researchers have treated two cancer patients the first-ever human CRISPR trial in the United States. One patient has myeloma, a cancer of white blood cells, and sarcoma, a cancer in the bones and soft tissue. Through gene editing, the researchers want to alter the patientsâ immune cells' function towards fighting the cancers.  \n",

            "A recent Penn-led study identified a particularly toxic form of the protein Elk-1, which provides clues to the first link between Huntingtonâs, Parkinsonâs and Alzheimerâs diseases. Researchers from the School of Medicine and the University of Rochester began with the knowledge â derived from past experimentation â that when a modified form of this protein, phospho-Elk-1, is located in the dendrite of a neuron, it is able to initiate cell death. âThis was the first protein that tied these three diseases together,â said James Eberwine, the senior author of the study and the co-director of the Penn Genome Frontier Institute. âIf this protein is indeed important to the neurodegenerative process, we would be able to look at phospho-Elk-1 as an early indicator of these diseases.â After inserting mutated Elk-1 into dendrites and cell bodies, the researchers were able to prove that this protein could be manipulated in the dendrite to cause the death of a cell. The authors of this study then compared levels of phospho-Elk-1 in tissue afflicted by Alzheimerâs, Parkinsonâs and Huntingtonâs diseases and realized that this particular protein was significantly more present in the diseased tissues than disease-free tissue. Professor of Pharmacology Jai-Yoon Sul, a fellow author of the study, said, âElk-1 is one of the first proteins that has defined function in the cell in terms of neurodegenerative disease markers â¦ It isnât just a pathological marker, but also has the function of collapsing the dendrite and killing the cell.â Eberwine added that if the researchers can identify the specific enzymes â called protein kinases â that cause Elk-1 to mutate in this manner, âthere might be reasonable therapeutic topicsâ that could aid people inflicted with these diseases. âWe could do drug screens to see if we could modulate the kinase activity so that we would no longer get cell death or clumps of proteins that are characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases,â he said. However, Eberwine said while the study showed correlation, it did not prove that this protein caused the three neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, Eberwine and Sul emphasized that this study will not lead to a complete cure for Alzheimerâs, Huntingtonâs or Parkinsonâs, since these diseases are caused by genetic defects that are very difficult to reverse. However, the study does lay foundations for future studies examining therapeutic interventions that would be able to delay the onset of the symptoms of these diseases. âAnything that leads toward understanding diseases and making their symptoms less severe can save money, time, and create a better lifestyle for those who are inflicted,â Eberwine said. âIf you can delay the onset of the disease for just four or five years, youâve saved trillions in healthcare dollars.â Eberwine and Sulâs findings were published in the beginning of February in the online journal PLoS One. The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Mental Health, according to a Penn Med press release.\n",

            "A study led by Penn Medicine professor Mitesh Patel found that patients are more likely to track their physical activity levels by using a smartphone, rather than a wearable device, Penn Medicine News reported. Patel, who is also the director of Penn Medicine's Nudge Unit, found that discharged patients who used smartphones to track their daily step counts were 32% more likely than those using wearable devices to continue sending the information to the researchers six months after leaving the hospital, according to Penn Medicine News. âMost people with smartphones take them everywhere they go. Since carrying the phone is already a built-in habit, it makes it much easier to use the device to track activity levels,â Patel told Penn Medicine News. Patel also told Penn Medicine News that wearable devices are more unreliable because a patient can take it off and \"never put it back on again.\" The researchers also found that men were more likely to report data than women, and patients with Medicaid insurance were less likely to report their data than patients with other insurance, according to Penn Medicine News. The research team selected 500 patients from two different Philadelphia hospitals and placed them into two groups, Penn Medicine News reported. The participants were either given an app on their smartphones or a wearable device to track their daily steps after being discharged from the hospitals. âOur everyday health behaviors contribute significantly to our longerâterm health,â Penn medical professor Kevin Volpp told Penn Medicine. âThese mobile devices give us a window into daily activity patterns that could be used to help design interventions to improve health outcomes.â Former Penn Medicine professor and co-author of the study Daniel Polsky noted different potential uses for using smartphone apps and wearable devices, Penn Medicine News reported. âItâs important to consider the tradeoffs between smartphones that may be used for longer periods and wearables that can track other types of data like heart rate or sleep patterns,â Polsky told Penn Medicine News. âWith that, itâs important to consider all factors and their affects, which could include things like demographic information.â A 2015 Penn Medicine study found that smartphones and wearable devices were both accurate methods for measuring physical activity. The study was part of research predicting the likelihood of patients being readmitted to the hospital after discharge, according to Penn Medicine News. The researchers will next examine whether smartphones or wearable devices can better predict readmission.\n",

            "With this yearâs replacement of Aramark by Bon Appetit as Pennâs food service provider, much of the schoolâs dining experience has been overhauled. But Chef Brian Walcott is no stranger to change. He is now working his 25th year in Pennâs dining halls. A chef in 1920 Commons, Walcott represents the frontline of trying to transform the Penn dining experience for the better. A look around the Commons dining hall reveals the shift in focus that Bon Appetit has brought to the table.  Fruits and vegetables are used as decorations â and they may be in the next dish served, reflecting Bon Appetitâs heavy emphasis on using local and in-season ingredients. A Mediterranean bar has been added, and an herb garden has been started in the downstairs part of Commons. For Walcott, originally from Jamaica, this focal point has been a welcome breath of fresh air. âIâm very passionate about what I do and cooking from scratch has allowed me to be very creative,â he said. As an employee under both food providers, Walcott pointed out the stark contrast between Aramark and Bon Appetit. âWe were never really educated with Aramark,â he said. âHowever, now we are educated about everything that we are cooking and serving.â  While most of the food products from Aramark came frozen, Walcott indicated that with the switch to Bon Appetit, everything is now fresh and prepared from scratch. âWe have a farmerâs dinner where we invite them to come and see how we prepare their products,â he said. Walcottâs favorite change has been the increased autonomy Bon Appetit has granted its chefs. The chefs are asked to come up with their own recipes for dishes and can also cook student requests if they are submitted. While Aramark ran on a cycle menu â a repeating schedule of what was served â Bon Appetit has no set menu and will cook what is local and available. âItâs very inspiring to use my own style every day when cooking,â Walcott said. âIf Iâm not creative, the group wonât be inspired by my creation.â Walcottâs personal favorite dish to make is a red snapper with peppers, onions, carrots and a little bit of soy sauce. Like any talented chef, Walcott considers himself king of the kitchen. He said whenever there is a cooking challenge, he wins. âWe challenge each other every day when we come in and cook,â he said, adding, âAnd the kids are enjoying the results very much.â Walcott considers his mother his inspiration for cooking and fondly remembers her preparations. âI donât want to brag about it,â he began before rattling off some of his motherâs delicious creations. In the end, Walcott is all about feeling good about what you do in life. âI love my job,â he said without hesitation.\n",

Kevin Sbraga, the winner of season seven of Bravoâs âTop Chef,â will open the Fat Ham on 31st and Walnut streets on Dec. 6. The menu will center around southern country cooking with a twist. âThe Fat Ham is influenced by the experiences I had growing up. Itâs a place where friends and family can gather for good conversation and a simple dinner prepared with the freshest ingredients,â Sbraga said in a press release on Wednesday. âItâs a communal, lively experience unlike anything else on the Philly dining scene.â Related: Famed chef to open Mexican eatery on Locust Items on the menu took shape after a two-week culinary road trip around the South. A particularly important stop was in Avery Island, La. â known as the home of Tabasco. There, Sbraga developed new ideas for his housemade hot sauce recipe. Most of the menu will be small plate items, which will encourage family-style dining. Items on the menu include smoked lamb belly, oyster sliders and baked macaroni and cheese with a potato chip crust. True to its name, the menu will be pork-centric. Besides food, the Fat Ham will stock a cocktail program. The drink menu will focus on whiskies and other ingredients such as herbs and fruit preserves. A variety of drinks will be barrel aged in two casks on top of the bar. Signature cocktails on tap will include the Montgomery Mule â a mix of vodka, peach infused vodka, lemon juice and ginger beer â and the Fat Apple, a drink blended from hard cider, apple cider and ginger ale. Related: Fried chicken joint opens to customers The restaurant will seat up to 45 people, and is designed to reflect the experience of dining in a southern home. The seating will be upholstered in cowhides and artwork featuring animals will hang on the walls. Sbraga completed the rustic feel by using an eclectic group of chairs and setting the tables with simple dishes and mixed glassware. The Fat Ham will serve dinner Sunday through Thursday between 5 and 10 p.m., and on Friday and Saturday between 5 and 11 p.m. This is Sbragaâs second restaurant in Philadelphia.

            "Whether you loved it or you hated it, meal plans during freshman year were convenient, offering constant access hot, ready meals with just a swipe.And for upperclassmen â many of whom leave the meal plan behind â relying on groceries, cooking and restaurants can cause a real change in lifestyle.âI feel like I eat a lot healthier now that Iâm no longer on a meal plan,â said College sophomore Natalie Breuel. âI like to go to the farmerâs market and the grocery store on the weekends, and then Iâll cook a big batch of something that I can freeze and eat for the rest of the week. It means I donât have to really think about it throughout the weekday.âThe Fresh Grocer and Trader Joeâs are generally priced low. Items like granola bars and produce are much cheaper when bought in bulk at these stores when compared to individual item pricing at on campus stops like Gourmet Grocer and Houston Hall.âI definitely find it so much easier to eat more fruits and vegetables this year,â said Engineering sophomore Kerry Hollis. âBeing vegan while eating at the dining halls is so difficult because the options are so limited. And buying things with dining dollars at overpriced places on campus was frustrating.âNot paying for a dining plan means that much more money in a studentâs budget can be devoted to meals eaten out. A meal bought at Sweetgreen, Honeygrow or another popular locale comes out cheaper than the true cost of a meal swipe. Food trucks are inexpensive and fast when thereâs little time between classes.âI make my own breakfast and dinner but for lunch I usually go to a food truck,â said Wharton junior Joe Egan. âBuiâs on 38th and Walnut is my go-to.âFreshman adjusting to dining dollars and meal swipes have months to decide whether or not to sign up in their next year. Penn students are lucky enough to have access to grocery stores, markets, and take-and-go options that make a lifestyle out of dining halls possible.âI got off the meal plan as soon as I could and I recommend it,â said College senior Caroline Garth. âI like to cook for myself, so typically Iâll have grilled chicken, pasta, or salad. And when I really need it thereâs always microwave mac nâ cheese. That meal will always be a keeper.â\n",

            "Even with the abundance of restaurants and food options in and around Philadelphia, some students at Penn still find it challenging to find options each day. Navigating Penn and Philadelphia dining can be harder for students who follow certain diets, like College freshman Kaylee Slusser who has been lactose intolerant her whole life and started eating gluten-free two weeks before coming to Penn.  âIt was definitely a lot easier [to be gluten- and dairy-free] at home,\" Slusser said.\"My family eats very well normally, and usually thereâs not a lot of gluten products in my house, and I could go grocery shopping myself more easily.âRegarding Penn's on-campus dining options, Slusser said that there are often gluten-free options, but since she is dairy-free too, it makes things considerably harder.âThe dining halls are generally okay, but I definitely have to check to make sure thereâs chicken. Otherwise itâs an all-fruit kind-of thing. Thereâs a decent amount of gluten-free options at meals, but thereâs definitely some days where Iâll go into the dining hall and get an apple,â Slusser said.Off-campus, Slusser finds that there are often options in most Philadelphia restaurants that cater to her diet.âI definitely feel like thereâs options for me anywhere,\" Slusser said. \"I think people are a lot more accustomed to it now because itâs not only an allergy that people accommodate too, but itâs also a diet-trend, which makes it a lot easier.â College freshman Lena Greenberg, who also eats gluten-free, agrees that a greater awareness of gluten-free diets has led to more options and a more noticeable effort to create options at Penn too.âI think thereâs a greater awareness of gluten intolerance, and in the dining halls, you can request things to be made gluten-free and people are always sensitive when I say Iâm gluten-free â everyone seems to immediately get that and respect that,â Greenberg said.Other students on different diets at Penn have had an easier time finding options, such as College freshman Natasha Iotov, who has been vegan for four months now due to ethical reasons. Iotov said that the dining halls make it easy on her with clear signs as to what she can and cannot eat. âThey made it really easy â there are dark green stickers that say âvegan,'\" Iotov said. \"They make it really clear with the sticker.\" College junior Brianna Krejci, a vegan for two-and-a-half years, agreed with Iotov that it is not too hard to be a vegan both at Penn and in the city of Philadelphia.  âIn the East Coast in general and a city in general, there are a lot more options that seemed readily accessible,â said Krejci, who is originally from Wisconsin. âI could always just Yelp the word âveganâ and a ton of different restaurants came up, and so [the transition] was actually really easy compared to being at home.â Both Krejci and Iotov are pleased with how easy it's been to maintain their vegan diets. âI would definitely recommend Penn as a vegan-friendly campus,\" Iotov said. \"I was definitely very pleasantly surprised by the vegan options at Penn.â\n",

            "Philadelphia has three chances of snow between today and next weekend. The first chance of snow will come Sunday night into Monday as a weak storm slides across the Midwest and into the Great Lakes region. It will be cold enough in our area to start off as snow, but will eventually transition to rain since we are on the âwarm sideâ of the storm. However, there is still a question on how much snow will accumulate before we see temperatures warm up. The farther north that you go, the more likely you are to see upwards of 5â of snow. As you get closer to the city, our chances of snow sticking decrease. Right now, I think it is probable that Penn could see a brief coating to as much as an inch overnight Sunday. Although, it looks as though most of us will wake up to wet weather rather than white.The second storm that could bring us some snow looks to be similar to a coastal storm, which comes up the Eastern Seaboard and provides the area with snow. This looks to have a little more in the way of cold air in place, meaning that a changeover to rain may not be that much of an issue. The problem with this system is whether or not it will come close enough to affect us. If there is too much cold air in place, storms may not be able to come within reasonable distance of the East Coast because High Pressure can push it southward instead. Right now, itâs too early to determine which way this storm will play out, but I am more confident in seeing snow out of this system than Sunday night. Lastly, the third chance next weekend appears similar to the first storm system, but is even farther in the future, so I am not confident about saying which solution will come to fruition. The point is that there are multiple chances for snow over the coming days, with no shortage of cold air. The question is now: can we get the cold air to time itself with a storm? \n",

Additionally, The Burger Stop has been replaced by the Burger and Sandwich Stop, expanding the menu to include panini sandwiches and items such as the âUltimate Grilled Cheeseâ, Lampitt added.

            "Saraâs column isnât out to make any friends. Sheâs OK with that. Friendship isnât about quantity, right? Itâs about quality. But intimate and frank discussions about friendships are at best awkward, which often drags with it a hostile response. So maybe the reflex to argue with her logic just goes with the territory.How valuable it is that Sara, nevertheless, demands that level of reflection! Itâs timely, too. The semester began unhappily. A lot of people, in a lot of different ways, expressed a lot of dissatisfaction towards the caliber of attention and care they receive as students here at Penn. To make it worse, the cold, isolating winter just wouldnât let go. Now, at the end of these lonely months, a long break appears ahead, one that will interrupt, though hopefully only temporarily, the relationships that have been slowly and often deliberately forged during this time.Looking forward to summerâs approaching separation, her idea of âfriendshipâ deserves not more definition, but more fleshing out. The category of âfriendâ is expansive.  Sometimes usefully, sometimes not, itâs also vague. It rarely excludes, but it also rarely clarifies, either. Saraâs article courageously insists that we take our friendships more seriously. She contrasts friendships with erotic relationships, which tend to be considered with greater discourse and greater delicacy. For Sara, one symptom of friendshipâs relative low worth among college students is the reluctance to end friendships definitively, with a closure that romantic relationships, by contrast, evidently merit.It doesnât help that the category of âfriendâ is now experienced alongside digital representations of the category, like those proliferating on Facebook. The idea used to be that âFriendsâ on Facebook represent friends in real life, but of course, friendships are variable, not only among acquaintances, but also through time. Nevertheless, that Facebook has persisted as a dynamic resource for social life suggests that the category, even if artificial, is comforting in important ways.Saraâs argument derives rhetorical force from tapping into a similar desire, the desire for categories by which to define the sometimes uncomfortable attachments and compulsions that animate all relationships, not only the erotic. Still further, the category is desirable for its use in asserting control over how those attachments change over time. But to define brings with it the power to limit, to outline, to draw the boundaries. That power is also a power to declare an end, and this degree of control can be valuable, even necessary for self-preservation, for mental and social health, as Sara describes. Accordingly, she encourages readers to imagine âbreaking upâ with âtoxicâ friends. But the definition of a friend â specifically what disqualifies someone from that title â as well as the instability of such a category, remains unchallenged. To define a âfriendâ goes against the grain of what is so rich and valuable about friendships â qualities like flexibility, pliability and resilience. She acknowledges these qualities when she begins narrating imaginary scenes of first arriving at college: Among all the new acquaintances, itâs nearly impossible to tell with certainty which of these will turn out to be the closest, dearest friends. Furthermore, itâs a chimera to identify which friends did, over the years, emerge as dearest: It only identifies them in their present condition. It is not a comprehensive description. Sara values the mutability of friendship, its ability to change over time, certainly, but her eagerness and desire to define or assert control over her experience of friendship seems to express dissatisfaction with these variables. It is an understandable fear, the fear of change, but her prescription appears perilously similar to the problem itself: the fiction of an ideal and consistent friend.Perhaps a more productive line of inquiry, although a no less awkward one, would be to consider friendships on an individual scale, probe and inquire into what makes each satisfactory â or not. Then â and it would be a long then â one might assess from personal experience: What do I want from my friendships? What defines the experience for me? Beyond what boundary will I refuse to extend the name of âfriendâ? And, perhaps most importantly, how might my future relationships affect my confidence in this boundary?This might, in some cases, require rejecting previously held standards or ideals of friendship, breaking up with abstractions in favor of reality.There is no answer to these questions, as of course, there can never definitively be. Saraâs opinion, however, has and will probably continue affect on many friendships, making her, in a small sense, friend to many.\n",

            "Two weeks ago, I made the argument that religion, much like any other force in the world, should not be exempt from our critical judgment in terms of the effects it has on society â we cannot, I argued, simply divorce religion from the real world and think of it in isolation or only in an individualized sense. As an example of this, I discussed activist and author Ayaan Hirsi Aliâs criticism of Islam and argued that these kinds of arguments, even for all the sanctity we attach to religion, deserve space and attention in the public discourse if they bear merit.There are two sides to this coin, however. Just like religion can be criticized for any detrimental effects it has on society, it can likewise be rightly endorsed for its benefits.In the recently published CNN piece âThe Friendly Atheists Next Door,â we get to follow the family of Harry Shaughnessy, a regular American who tossed Catholicism aside for atheism after struggling with reconciling his own views with the faith with which he was brought up.For many like Harry and his family, the atheist social movement that has received increasing attention in the last decade has been a source of comfort and empowerment. Figures like evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and neuroscientist Sam Harris â known for their public engagement in speaking out against religion in various forms â have, to many, represented the vanguards of this movement.âIf you take your God too seriously,â Harry noted about the British biologist, âDawkins will piss you off.âIndeed he might; Dawkins, perhaps more than his peers among the public faces of âNew Atheism,â has been relentless in his crusade against religion. His criticism, most famously outlined in âThe God Delusion,â is anchored in the bare scientific infeasibility of many of the supernatural premises common to religions, like the existence of God and miracles.What he and many other proponents of the New Atheism movement often lend too little attention to, however, is the intricate role of religion to society. His view on religion, as it appears, implies that since religion contains components which cannot be forced under a microscope for hard scientific scrutiny, it would do best to be ripped away from the world and eradicated. A secular world, it is all too obvious, is preferable. He himself, he often asserts, is perfectly fine without religion â but does this apply to everyone?Ãmile Durkheim, often dubbed one of the three founding fathers of sociology along with Weber and Marx, would argue otherwise. Indeed, to the contrary of popular projections at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries that religion would succumb to an increasingly rationalized society, religion remains pervading and vigorous today. Durkheim believed that the track record of religion speaks for its merits to human societies, functioning like a moral and social unifier; a kind of glue, the loss of which could actually result in a far greater degree of damage to social society than the negatives of its preservation would. On an individual level, religion often also has a spiritual importance to a personâs own conception of who they are and how they understand the world.Even if some of the supernatural properties of religion do not stand the test of science, does this mean that we are right to reject religion without further ado? This is where Dawkins, and many of his peers, makes a mistake by assuming that scientific truth must necessarily guide all spheres of life.Certainly, many of us do not need religion to get along in life, but the kind of evangelical atheism where Dawkins and others impose irreligion on others often only replicates some of the practices in religion they go after themselves. Ironically, large parts of the atheist movement associated with Dawkins and the New Atheists are surprisingly faith based, taking the leap of faith that science holds all the answers.Far from arguing whether or not religion is necessary to society, I have tried to argue that claiming it to have no place in society needs to go far beyond arguing for its scientific infeasibility, but is an argument that requires us to take into account both its benefits and detriments.

            "When Benjamin Franklin refers to âsilenceâ on his list of virtues, he means not totally abstaining from speech, but rather speaking only when one has something useful to say. I decided that this week, I would live up to this virtue by trying to eliminate all filler conversation, including complaining. I especially wanted to focus on expelling that worst kind of idle chatter â gossip about other people â from my chit-chat repertoire.The verdict of the experiment? Cutting the crap out of my everyday language was hard. When silence fell over a conversation, I would search the recesses of my mind for any material, however banal, to break it â which led to me chattering on about a lot of silly, inconsequential topics. It also became clear that a huge portion of what I talked about with people was complaining. We complained about all of the work we had, our teachers, our friends, our significant others, our job prospects and any other topic we could think of.It goes without saying that this insidious negativity in so much of the small talk among students feeds into the general atmosphere of stress and pressure on campus. However, because everyone around me was doing it, I found it difficult to avoid negative conversation altogether. While it might be possible to abstain completely by being either reclusive or incredibly selective in your choice of friends, I realized that both of these options would be much too difficult for me. I have given up on ever omitting idle chatter, especially complaining, completely from my life.In fact, talking about the issues in our lives can be cathartic. I thus wouldnât even advocate completely restricting conversation to only what is useful, and I kind of doubt old Ben was successful in that endeavor throughout his long life either. Though really, it depends on how you define useful; sometimes, the calming effect of talking out an issue in itself lends the complaint a certain degree of utility.But there is no denying that lots of gossip around Penn, including many unfortunate sentences that have come out of my own mouth, can turn vicious pretty quickly. Sometimes it was possible for me to extricate myself from a conversation that was taking a turn for the catty â for instance, if it was winding  down anyway, or if I had something I needed to do. When this wasnât possible, I tried to shift the tone of the conversation by pointing out something positive about the person in question or making some kind of generalizing, neutral statement, such as âWell, weâll see,â or âI have to admit I donât understand much about the situation.â Is this a cop-out? Maybe. But I found it to be an easier solution than abstaining from conversation 90 percent of the time or lecturing to my friends constantly.I also wonder if the two problems I discussed above are related. Perhaps a fear of silence in casual conversation leads us to search for something else to say, and of course the first thing most of us would think of would be the issues weighing on us most. So maybe we could learn to embrace the silences of our conversations, rather than avoid them? Some of the closest people I know, like couples who have been married for years, are very comfortable in their silences with one another. This speaks to the fact that lack of filler conversation might be a sign of greater intimacy, rather than lack thereof.Even though I didnât cut negative talk from my speech entirely, I did reduce it â and I have to admit it made me feel much healthier about myself to know that I was not focusing as much on the negative aspects of my life or other people. So in general, based on my experiment, Iâd say if you want to try it, go for it. Reducing negativity in our conversation could only improve the overall social and intellectual vibe of this campus. And thatâs a great thing. GINA ELIA is a graduate student from Hingham, Mass. Her email address is ginaelia@sas.upenn.edu. âThe Benjamin Franklin Experimentâ appears every other Monday.\n",

            " I am grateful to have met many people over the course of my time at Penn who are passionate. Many students are driven to make changes in the Penn community, and our larger society, by being activists both on and off campus. They regularly speak out about the injustices they see, whether it be transphobia, racism   or sexism. I am proud to know people who take the seemingly commonsense idea of equality to the next level and constantly challenge others to re-examine their personal prejudices and biases.   Yet Penn has also introduced me to the darker side of social activism that comes from a place of self-righteousness. Instead of concentrating on increasing awareness for a cause, some have used their social involvement to exude a sense of superiority with the lack of experience to back it.   Too often have I come across a situation such as this one. A white student makes an ignorant, but not always malicious, racial comment in the presence of another white student. This second student will go on to name   drop multiple articles that have come up in the classroom and chide this classmate for displaying âwhite privilegeâ and âinsensitivity.â   As a person of color,   I am appreciative to those who stand up to racism when they encounter it. But students cannot use their activism as an excuse to ignore their own privileges. Much of social activism comes from a personal vested interest in the cause, such as being a member of a marginalized group. But there is also a sense of smugness that has befallen the Penn community, where one thinks that simply reading up on a subject or joining an activist group makes them both completely knowledgeable about inequality and morally superior to others.   I donât care how many gender and sexuality courses you take   or how many books you have read about multiracial women of color in America. You will never truly know my experiences if you have not had them yourself. Speaking   on behalf of others without first acknowledging your own removal from the subject is at best distasteful. It only serves to put the focus of attention on yourself rather than the cause you are fighting for.   Academia is not an excuse for laziness. If you are intent on making this campus, and the world, a better place, your intentions should come from an inner drive rather than conceit. Forwarding links to scholarly articles cannot replace intimate conversation between peers, and correcting someoneâs insensitivity does not allow you to overlook your own.   For example, my fellow columnist Roderick Cook   has discussed the need for intersectionality in the queer activist community. I have been in social gatherings that encourage the use of proper pronouns only to make unnecessary comments on race. Only focusing on one area of activism without acknowledging all of the different social factors that come into play when discussing inequality is hypocritical and exclusionary.   Penn is also notorious for failing to acknowledge a particular elephant in the room: socioeconomic status. We must recognize that as a whole, many of us tend to come from well-off backgrounds. We have to consider how this has shaped our outlook as well as that of others. Because so much inequality is tied to class, it needs to be addressed when we think about social activism on campus. The resources we as Penn students have vary considerably across the student body, as well as   our larger community.   It is important to make your voice heard in the quest for social change, but before preaching to others, you must first look inward. Even as a woman of color, I cannot ignore the other privileges I have been afforded. Had I grown up as my parents did, I may not have made it to Penn. But their determination to provide a better life for their children got me to where I am today. Before patting yourself on the back for thinking all people should be treated equally, take the time to truly understand your place in society. Use the advantages you do have to combat the injustices you have experienced or witnessed. A holier-than-thou attitude has no place in the fight for social justice.  \n",

            "Iâve been called âpretty whiteâ a few times in my life. Now, if you look at my headshot, I think it becomes clear that Iâm Asian, and if you look at my last name, it becomes even clearer that Iâm Korean. So, calling me âpretty whiteâ means nothing from a physical standpoint. Itâs a measure of how someone acts, not how someone looks.So what makes me âpretty white?â Am I âpretty whiteâ because my Korean is mediocre, I donât really listen to K-pop and Iâm not really part of the Korean community at Penn? Am I âpretty whiteâ despite the fact that my parents are first-generation immigrants and I spent 10 years in Korea and went to elementary school there? Does my cultural absorption into the mainstream Americana negate my experiences?When you pick apart the assumptions wrapped around the statement âyouâre pretty white,â it becomes clear that itâs only a way of saying that âYouâre culturally removed from your ethnicity and have been absorbed as part of mainstream American culture, and you donât really care about the pop culture that is stereotypically associated with your ethnic group.âNow hereâs the interesting bit: Iâve heard âyouâre pretty whiteâ from both white people and people of color â in my case, specifically Asians.When white people say âyouâre pretty white,â itâs a racist statement prettily wrapped in a compliment. Is it derogatory to you in particular? No. Does it somewhat imply that being white is superior to being of color? Yes. But thatâs an entirely different column and one that has been written before.When Asians say âyouâre pretty white,â itâs much stranger conceptually. Itâs a judgment of where you fall in the assimilation spectrum, and often vaguely negative, coming coupled with the implication that you are selling out on your culture. Calling someone âpretty whiteâ isnât a measure of race, but of how much of your ethnic culture and pop culture you do not identify with, and itâs a ridiculous conflation.My point is this: âWhiteâ should not be considered âaverage,â and a person of color does not ever stop being their particular race regardless of cultural consumption, and often these two factors are blended by ethnic minorities. But being part of a minority does not make you the authority on what it is, culturally, which makes someone part of that minority, nor does being part of the mainstream culture fundamentally change your experience of race.This is the point in the column where I admit to also having told people that theyâre âpretty whiteâ because they donât adhere to what I expect from them.Coming from an immigrant family or being part of an ethnic minority often means that you â consciously or unconsciously â view yourself in degrees of assimilation. Thereâs a reason that people talk about how many generations removed from foreign birth they are, as if the degree of oneâs cultural assimilation is a function merely of time. Which, granted, it is in some amount.I think thereâs a tendency among immigrant-descended minorities to measure oneself by how âwhiteâ you are versus how âyour race hereâ you are. While I can only speak to my subjective experience and the experiences of those that I know personally, I know that among my friends the term âbananaâ and âfobâ were pretty popular. Banana, meaning yellow on the outside and white on the inside, and fob, meaning fresh-off-the-boat. All of these are crude terms that measure how assimilated you are into the mainstream culture, and the mainstream culture is conflated with whiteness.Of course, the logical dismissal of my argument is to say that Iâm making a big deal over a phenomenon that, in the end, lacks obvious malice. Itâs verbal shorthand for description of a personâs particular interests and cultural tendencies. But conflation of popular culture or particular experiences and tendencies with race only serves to uphold the assumption that experience is synonymous with race.\n",

            "I am also religious. I believe in God, I study religious texts and I pray three times a day. I observe the Sabbath and my father is a rabbi. Whatâs more, I agree with you that Penn Secular Societyâs poster is unnecessarily provocative. It presents a silly straw man of what it means to be religious, and it implies that weâve never realized that some verses in our holy texts donât jive with our modern liberal values. You probably found that as condescending as I did. And yet, I beg of you, please stop. Youâre just making us look bad. I would have hoped that your religion would cultivate a love even for those who disagree with you, and I regret that your time on a university campus hasnât yet taught you to handle differing opinions like an adult. I canât play God, and I certainly donât believe that my religious expression is the only valid one, but I think that if you want to let the Divine into your life, there are better ways than throwing coffee on other peopleâs ideas. Being a religious student poses its challenges, and yet it can be a beautiful thing.

            "I believe in God. Iâm almost hesitant to start with that because I know many people will write me off immediately. Hereâs another article about religion; hereâs another crazy fanatic raving intolerance and ignorance. Please. Just hear me out.Last week, a preacher was protesting gays in the most hateful and aggressive way right in the center of our campus. He was wearing a sign that said, âYou deserve hell,â and screaming it at the LGBT students rallying right across from him. I was horrified and ashamed. As if we Christians, we religious people in general, didnât already have enough of a bad reputation.The biblical rules against homosexuality have always been one of the core problems I have had with my faith. I have never been able to reconcile a God who could hate love with a God who is supposed to be the incarnation of love. The Bible says that man should not lay with man; itâs supposed to be Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. But I could never understand why. How could God call it sin for two people to love each other, who never hurt anyone, who couldnât help it? Some Christians say itâs a choice to be gay. Maybe some people choose, but Iâm heterosexual and attracted to men, and I never chose that. I donât buy that argument.Other Christian friends tell me that gays are sinning, but their sin is no more wrong than lying or cheating or being selfish, which we all do. My friends say we have to love them anyway, just as we love other sinners, just as we still love ourselves. I hate this position the most. Itâs condescending. Why, I ask over and over. Why is it a sin to love someone? Because they werenât the right gender to love? Then we have to excuse them, as if we are being God.Iâll say it again: I could never believe in a God who condemns innocent people. The Bible says lots of crazy things â Iâll be the first to admit that. The Old Testament allowed slavery, the Old Testament sanctioned stoning as punishment, yet I donât see anyone trying to hold on to these laws. âYou canât pick and choose what to believe in the Bible!â friends tell me. I partially agree, but if we ignore some laws, why is this the one people try to hold on to? If the Bible describes a God who denounces people just for being, then I canât believe in that kind of God. I donât want to.There are lots of things I can never reconcile with my faith. I will never understand why good people go to hell, why God allows suffering in the world, why people who follow Him can still find acres of misery and trouble. I still believe in Him anyway. As much as intellectuals try to make religion about reason and logic, faith â at some point â boils down to emotion and intuition.If Iâm being honest, I believe in God because at the times when I struggled, when I was loneliest, when I felt weakest, when I felt as if I couldnât stand to see the next day, a belief in some higher power was the only thing that gave me strength. I believe in God because when I see the intricacy of the world, the way fates and lives can intertwine, I believe that none of it could have happened by chance.I wonât try to justify contradictions, like many Christians try to do, because they are inexplicable. All our religious answers are just sophistry. I wonât tie up my argument with a nice little conclusion like the Bible is all metaphoric and dependent on context, so God is actually tolerant. The ambiguity of faith is intentional and necessary, just as ambiguity is necessary in any relationship. Why do I love this person, even though sometimes they disappoint me? Because at the end of the day, weâve built trust and a bond that forms our very foundation, even if we donât completely agree on everything. I canât be rid of it.I donât believe that God finds homosexuality to be a sin. I know many Christians will scream at me for saying that, but I donât care. Itâs what I believe, and faith is not always about strict adherence to a set of laws. We Christians arenât all like the town crier proclaiming hellfire on everyone. Some of us struggle with your same doubts about our faith. We donât all follow blindly.AMY CHAN is a College junior from Augusta, Ga., studying English and classics.

            " S  i  nce    the election of President Obama, many people have tried to claim that we are a colorblind, post-racial society. It is an all-too-common claim of tolerance, especially on a campus as culturally diverse as ours: âSome of my best friends are Black/Asian/Latino/etc.,â âI donât see race,â âColor doesnât matter to me.â   The notion of being colorblind is a widely claimed identity for individuals who want to express their openness and respect for all cultures, particularly when this tolerance is challenged by others. They will point to a diverse group of friends, or even a significant other, as proof of this acceptance. This is pretty common at schools such as Penn, which has students from many different countries and backgrounds.   When people say they are colorblind, they most likely mean to demonstrate that race or ethnicity do not influence their judgments of a person, or hinder their ability to be respectful towards someone else. People will be proud of themselves for not describing race when discussing another individual. This only promotes the idea that it just isnât polite to talk about or mention race, but the racial problems of society and the conversations around them do not suddenly disappear.   Those who express the idea of colorblindness often have the privilege of not needing to constantly think in terms of race. As a person of color, I donât get to be colorblind.   âSeeingâ race doesnât make someone a racist â reducing an individual to their race does. The pervasiveness of the idea of colorblindness has taught people to attempt to overlook race and ethnicity altogether, which prevents us from learning from each other the nuanced perspectives our individual cultures bring to the table.   As a black and Romanian-American woman, I have great pride in my rich family heritage. But I have also had to develop a strong sense of self-esteem to protect my identity from people of all races who still see the mixing of black and white as unacceptable. Throughout the course of my life, I have encountered many situations in which I felt like I didnât belong anywhere â people often pick and choose the parts of my identity they are comfortable with and ignore the rest. I am reminded constantly of the consequences of my blackness, my biracial identity, my otherness in society.   It is clear that there are severe flaws in the way that we conceive of race. But my ethnicity, my cultural heritage, is an important part of who I am. It has shaped not only my views of myself but my outlook on life. My mother was brought up with Southern-American values that influenced the way she raised my brother and me. My grandparents were immigrants from Europe, and they encouraged my father to work hard to make a better life for himself in a new country. This was an ethic he instilled in me.   People who say they are colorblind miss the point of cultural acceptance. Yes, you should not make assumptions about me or treat me unkindly because of the color of my skin. But you should also not strip me of the rich backgrounds that have shaped my life and made me who I am today.   People of all races and ethnicities are influenced by the impact their cultures have on their upbringing and experiences, even in ways we do not immediately realize. We are a nation of many different peoples, and those varying subgroups bring different perspectives, ideals and views. We do not live in a vacuum â we are influenced by our national as well as ethnic culture.   My parents were not colorblind. They were all too aware of their racial difference and what it entailed. But it did not stop them from seeing a likeness in each other and being able to start a family. That is the true meaning of transcending intolera  nce.

            "As a member of a community that prides itself on being at the forefront of the progressive, intellectual movement and someone who recognizes the real harms of socio-economic privilege, I feel compelled to respond to the article \"âPrivilege' does not exist to White Penn professors â and they keep 'trying it'\" by James Fisher. My compulsion is furthered by wanting to prevent a straw man of the true liberal spirit that points at and objects to socio-economic privilege, and to that end, I'd like to raise two questions.Firstly, were the authorâs descriptions of the traumatic experiences he had actually instances of showcased white privilege? Conveniently enough, to answer this question, we can refer to what the author intended as a demonstrative anecdote: \"He would show images of slaves on plantations and even allow students to say ignorant comments in class.\" This sentence serves wonderfully to distill the authorâs understanding of the problem and his actual expectations and allows us to push past the surface a little bit. The first part of the sentence seems to refer to a certain insensitivity that the author attributes to the professor for showing said images. I fail to understand how the author can simultaneously demand both a heightened education of the masses regarding historical oppression of black people and immunity from such images in the classroom of a premier university. This is, of course, not to undermine the possibility that such images could be provocative or traumatic to some, due to personal backgrounds, experiences or emotional states â but is that not an unavoidable cost of making everyone more cognizant of the brutal reality of our past, for what it was? The second part of the sentence, however, is more worrisome to me â mainly because of its increased prevalence as an opinion. The author argues that the professorâs claim that \"allowing everyone to express their opinion makes for a safe space\" is a standing example of privilege â where the emotions of the historically oppressed are not accounted for. To this, I have two responses. Firstly, the authorâs claim is a gross misrepresentation of the average student, who is, in fact, happy to participate in relevant socio-political discussions and does not plead any emotional fragility that supposedly accompanies belonging to such backgrounds. Of course, it is another thing to be facing downright insulting or racist comments â but even in these cases, Iâm willing to wager that the average student, though taken aback, would like to make that an educational moment. Secondly, this attitude defeats the objective of creating an \"educational safe space\" where students can feel free to make mistakes and learn by doing so. The danger of the author's claim extends beyond creating a lack of diversity in opinion in a university. Even from within a self-righteous bubble, it defeats the grander object of eradicating said ignorance systematically through discourse.This leads to the second broader question to be addressed. What is a useful way of looking at an expectation to have a safe space in a setting that primarily seeks to educate our youth? My stance on this matter is that we need to recognize a goal of making our students ready to face the world where trigger warnings donât pop up midair every time before a racially insensitive statement is going to be uttered. And the best way to achieve this, is to replicate the real world to some extent â by creating settings where students arenât promised that their protective bubbles won't be burst and are prepared to handle such conversations with or without an opinion.The general Penn community, I believe, is well-aware of what white privilege actually looks like â this is the subject of many a class and discussion, and many fight it on their way to Penn. I would however like to point out the worrisome trend of a \"new privilege\"â that the original article shows exists â the privilege to say \"I donât want to be exposed to these sorts of comments or topics, these sorts of spaces and these sorts of people because I might be emotionally affected or traumatized.\" Privilege is the freedom to claim entitlement or have possession of something that most or other people do not have â and a claim to this brand of \"safe space,\" is a privilege. The general masses that are systemically discriminated against and pay the full price of existent white privilege do not have that liberty. Now, perhaps we at Penn can afford to grant some of that privilege in the interest of maintaining emotional stability in a setting where there are a tremendous number of factors that seek to undermine it â but that cannot come at the price of creating important educational opportunities. Moreover, by misguidedly applying the principle, we face a grave danger of both being self-defeating and allowing some of the privileged to cry victim simply because they need to tip-toe around everything â a popular sentiment of \"overt political correctness\" that has great recent political influence. So as much as I sympathize with the generally large set of challenges that life at Penn can pose, on this count, I do not exercise any privilege in saying \"deal with it.\"SRIRAM SRIDHARAN is a College senior from Chennai, India, studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics and philosophy.

            "âWithout Freedom of Thought, there can be no such thing as Wisdom; and no such thing as public Liberty, without Freedom of Speech.â â Benjamin Franklin The United Nations recognizes free speech as a universal human right â but not really. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that the âright to freedom of expressionâ may âbe subject to certain restrictions,â and many countries have taken this ball and run with it. The interpretation that one personâs rights end where anotherâs feelings begin has been codified throughout the world, and restricting critical, offensive or indecent statements (whatever those terms mean) is all too common. It is with this in mind that Penn For Liberty is celebrating free speech this week ââ both the speech itself and the fact that we are in a privileged position in the United States and at Penn where our speech will not be censored. To evince this, weâre placing a Free Speech Wall next to the love statue. Come by with a marker and express yourself without being censored.  If someone writes something you disagree with, please respond to them and show them why theyâre wrong. We hope that youâll be respectful of each other. Weâll see how that turns out. One could claim that erecting this wall will only cause problems. Perhaps it is a risky endeavor. Yet, ultimately, free thought is only dangerous to those who seek to hinder truth. What we want is to give the Penn community the opportunity to express what it feels and thinks, without reservations. Let us see what comes up and face it. Silence does not change anything, and neither do thought and expression which are not liberated. What do we expect to happen with such a wall? What could possibly be said that would shake Penn to its core? Letâs say that we are waiting for the unexpected. Allowing anyone to say anything is exactly the principle for intellectual independence. We are willing to listen to anything. We shall face that which is not normally expressed, we shall confront it peacefully and we shall affirm our right to agree or disagree with it. Maybe this wall will not change the world, but it is only if we speak freely that the world will ever change at all. Let this be a wall for a freer world. Let this be a call for Freedom.

            "Three new members will join recently elected President Jane Meyer and Vice President Ray Clark on the Undergraduate Assemblyâs executive board.During internal elections on Sunday, College sophomore Michael Karam was elected UA Speaker, College sophomore Kat McKay was elected Treasurer and College sophomore Eric Tepper was chosen as Secretary.  Karam will replace College junior Andrew Robertson as UA speaker.  His major responsibility will be running the weekly UA meetings and moderating any debates that take place.âThe UA this year has set a precedent for being really effective.  I want to build off of that and keep moving forward,â Karam said, adding that in his campaign he focused on improving communication between the UA executive board and the general body. Tepper will replace College and Wharton sophomore Andrew Gegios as UA Secretary, taking on responsibilities such as recording notes at meetings.  He hopes to improve communication between the UA and the student body by improving the UA website and working closely with its communication team.  McKay will replace College senior Amanda Acosta-Ruiz as UA Treasurer.  Her main responsibility will overseeing the creation of next yearâs annual UA budget, supervising the allocation of University funds to student groups such as the Social Planning and Events Committee, class boards and the Student Activities Council.  McKay said that this yearâs budget proceedings under former treasurer Acosta-Ruiz were run very effectively and that she hopes to build upon this yearâs success.  She wants to continue to foster communication between the UA and the student groups that it funds.  âI definitely intend to help facilitate good relationships between student government branches,â she said. The candidates gave speeches and answered questions during a meeting on Sunday.  The internal elections process took place in a closed meeting during which members of the UA cast their votes. \n",

            "The Undergraduate Assembly held an open forum meeting Sunday night with a focus on boosting attendance from the Penn community. Despite low turnout from non-UA affiliated students, UA leaders said they still felt the event was a step in the right direction. âAbout seven people [who are] not associate members or UA members showed up,\" UA Speaker and College junior Brian Goldstein said.  Goldstein said although the UA was hoping for greater attendance, âitâs a start,â and expressed hope that future meetings would see greater participation from members of the Penn community. The open forum meeting operated the same as any regular UA general board meeting, all of which are already open to Penn students, UA Vice President and College junior Jordan Andrews said. The main difference with this meeting was the marketing of the event as an âopen forumâ to encourage students to attend and voice their opinions. âI think the goal really was just to publicize the fact that open forum is a thing that we have at every meeting,â Andrews said. Goldstein said the main objectives of advertising the open forum were to increase âawareness and transparency of what the UA doesâ and âto hear some opinions of people not in the UA.â Increased transparency is a goal that UA leaders said they are prioritizing this semester. In addition to the open forum, the UA is continuing their tabling initiative on Locust Walk, which began last fall. Through the initiative, Penn students can speak with UA leaders and voice questions or concerns in a face-to-face setting. Goldstein attributed low attendance at the open forum meeting to its date early in the semester and said the meeting could have been âmarketed a little better.â The meeting went âwell overall,â Andrews said, despite âroom for improvement in the future.â\n",

            " College sophomore Natalie Hernandez    resigned as Undergraduate Assembly Secretary on Sunday afternoon. Hernandez will still serve as a College representative.   Hernandez said that she is stepping down so she can focus on academics. In an email to the UA informing them of her decision, she stated that acting as UA secretary has been a rewarding experience but that her first priority is academics.   As secretary, Hernandez was expected to oversee administrative duties for the UAâs weekly general body and Steering meetings, as well as attend executive board and Cabinet meetings, serve as a liaison from one of the UAâs four committees to the executive board and plan bonding events for the UA general body   .   UA Communications director and College junior Robyn Saad   said that the UA â[praises] members ... who choose to give up positions in order to benefit the student body by providing the opportunity to someone who will better suit the job. â   The UA will hold internal elections at its Oct. 26 meeting to fill the position   .

            "For the most part, Penn wrestling lives to fight another day at the NCAA Championships.The opening slate of matches at Madison Square Garden featured one of the Red and Blueâs own, as junior Caleb Richardson competed in the 133-pound pigtail round. His opponent, Michiganâs Rosario Bruno, came in as a defending All-American but struggled to a 14-11 record in 2015-16. No one was able to get on the board in the opening period, but an escape early in the second period got Bruno on the board first. Richardson tied the score at 1-all the next period, forcing sudden victory. When no one could put points on the board, it headed to tiebreakers where the All-America proved too much for Richardson, securing the 2-1 win.With the loss, Richardson was pushed to the pigtail match in the consolation rounds, where he took on Northwesternâs Dominick Malone. His run at the tournament would end there. After falling behind 6-0 in the first period, Richardson wouldnât get closer, scoring only a single point on an escape as time ran out while Malone handed him a 14-1 defeat.After Richardsonâs first match, however, the Quakersâ saw action next when sophomore May Betheaâs turn came against Edinboroâs Austin Matthews at 157 pounds. There, the Red and Blue walked away with a much more favorable result.A takedown in the first minute gave Bethea a 2-0 lead over the tournamentâs 14-seed. After going up 6-3 after two periods, Matthews managed to even the score at 7-all. Thatâs where things stood when time ran out, but thanks to riding time, the sophomore was awarded a final point to give him the 8-7 win.Riding time proved to be a boon for Penn as 174-pounder Casey Kent took to the mats. Battling No. 8 Zach Epperly of Virginia Tech. After a scoreless first period, Epperly was controversially awarded two points on a reversal, and Tirapelle used one of his two challenges to dispute the call. After a video review, however, the points stood and Kent trailed, 2-0.Out of the review timeout, Kent immediately earned a point on an escape, then tied things up at two at the opening of the final period. âIt shows experience,â Penn coach Alex Tirapelle said of Kentâs response to the reversal call. âHeâs a veteran, he believes in himself. Heâs not done in this tournament.âNo one else would score in the match, but by the time the clock read 0:00, Kent had recorded enough riding time to get the extra point and the 3-2 upset.With the wins by Bethea and Kent, the Quakers became one of just six schools to defeat two seeded opponents in the opening round.But competition wasnât done quite yet, as Pennâs only seeded wrestler, No. 11 Lorenzo Thomas, had yet to compete at 184 pounds. Taking on West Virginiaâs Bubba Scheffel, neither grappler could score through two periods, though Thomas built up a sizable bank of riding time in the process.It got tight for Thomas in the third, falling behind, 2-1 early. He responded appropriately, however, securing a takedown to make it 3-2. It was the final time anyone would score in the match â excluding the eventual point the 11th-seeded wrestler got from riding time â as Thomas took home the 4-2 win in the first bout on his quest to repeat his 2014 All-American performance.âIt helps because Iâve been here before,â Thomas noted that evening. âI donât really get nervous. I mean, yeah, thereâs a big crowd, but Iâm used to doing it now. And I knew today was going to be a tough one and I had to stay focused match by match.âThat evening, the grapplers continued their run through the championship brackets.Bethea was tasked with facing No. 3 Jason Nolf out of Penn State, an opponent he had never matched up with before. He learned a lot about Nolf in the next seven minutes, trailing big, early. A 6-2 first period only got worse, culminating in a 25-10 technical fall and forcing Bethea into the consolation bracket.â[Bethea] came in, got a good win, knocked out one of the seeded guys, then he turned around and wrestled one of the best kids in the tournament at the weight,â Tirapelle said. âThe kidâs good. Hats off to him. Heâs better than us at this point. Hopefully we can close that gap moving forward, but right now, heâs just better than us.âI think Mayâs competed well. Itâs all about howâs heâs going to bounce back, respond, compete tomorrow morning.âJust a short while later, Kent and No. 9 Chandler Rogers got things going. When they met at the Southern Scuffle in January, Kent was the easy victor in a 10-0 decision.Things were a little different the second time around. After going down to Rogers, 12-2, in the first period, the next two minutes were scoreless. Before the third period could expire, however, Rogers managed to pin Kent and take the 19-6 win to advance to the quarterfinals.That left Thomas as Pennâs only competitor in the championship bracket. It would stay that way. Thomas concluded the eveningâs action for the Red and Blue, handily defeating No. 6 Blake Stauffer, 10-1. After netting six points in the opening period, Thomas controlled the match. While his opponent from Arizona State managed an escape to make it 6-1, Thomas netted three more points in the third period and topped it off with a point from riding time, securing his spot in the quarterfinals.âI just had to keep good positioning,â Thomas said. âI thought I had good positioning most of the much, gave him my legs a little easy, though. But I was able to work off of that, I thought I kept good positioning.âJust one win away from a second stint as an All-American, the 184-pounder must now face No. 14 Willie Miklus from Missouri. The two met at NCAAs last year, with Miklus walking away with the opening round win. âItâll be a good one to get out here and try to get one back,â he added.Bethea and Kent will also compete tomorrow, facing the more challenging path to All-American status through the consolation brackets. They will find out their opponents later this evening.\n",

            " It was a mistake to leave 174-pound senior Casey Kent unseeded â a mistake Kent would make his opponents pay for. Big time. The Norristown, Pa., native, who finished the weekend with a 6-2 record at NCAA Championships, was arguably the most dominant wrestler at Madison Square Garden on Friday.  Kent reeled off four consecutive wins on day two, three by pin and one by major decision. The third made him Pennâs 28th All-American.The streak not only kept him alive in the consolation bracket but put him in a position to claim a fourth place medal on Saturday morning.  Going into day two, there had been a lot of optimism following a very successful first day for the Quakers. But, after two matches and two losses, any momentum that the Quakers brought into the arena from their impressive opening performance was suddenly gone. Then came Casey Kent. The senior entered his first consolation bout against South Dakota Stateâs David Kocher as the Red and Blueâs last chance to grab a victory before the night session. Kent, who had already upset eighth-seeded Zach Epperly of Virginia Tech in the first round on Thursday, was fighting to stay alive in the wrestlebacks following a loss on Thursday evening. Kent dominated his opponent from start to finish, earning an 8-0 major decision victory.  Because Kent began the day in the loserâs bracket, he had to grapple for a second time in the afternoon session. This time his foe didnât go down so easy. Sixteen-seed Micah Barnes of Nebraska awaited the unseeded Kent. Barnes was the aggressor from the opening whistle, jumping out to an 8-1 lead in the first period after nearly pinning Kent. By the time the third period began, Kent was still down by seven and in need of a miracle. After 30 seconds, he got one. The two wrestlers were on their feet with their arms tied up when Kent shifted his weight and flipped Barnes off his feet and onto his back in a swift motion that sent the big Cornhusker slamming to the mat. The move, which seemed to appear out of thin air, caught Barnes â as well as everyone else in the arena â by surprise. âItâs a little bit different here,â Kent said of the road to the podium at NCAAs. âEveryone wants to place. No one just rolls over like they sometimes do in matches, but not here.â That match proved Kent wouldnât roll over himself and the pin seemed to ignite a fire under the senior, who rode the wave into the night session. After dropping his quarterfinal match earlier in the day, fellow senior 184-pounder Lorenzo Thomas joined Kent in the blood round â where All-American status is earned.  Thomas was facing Navyâs Mathew Miller for the third time this season and stepped on to the mat at the same time as Kent. Thomas shot in on Miller early on but was caught and put on his back for the pin, prematurely ending Thomasâ run. As Thomas fell on the adjacent mat, Kent picked up right where he left of against Oklahomaâs Matt Reed â only this time he dominated from the start. Up 3-0 in the third period, Kent stuck Reed for another pin and became Pennâs first All-American since Thomas in 2014. Not known to show too much emotion after his matches, Kent let out a big exhale and looked up while displaying a calmly clenched fist of elation. âIt just felt really good,â Kent said of the win, âkinda like a little bit of relief.â Despite his momentum, the senior grappler stayed poised and in the moment throughout his run. âIâm just wrestling the same,â he said after his All-American clinching victory. âKinda trying to do what I always do.â Only 30 minutes later Kent was back out on the mat, wrestling seventh seeded Cody Walters of Ohio. Miraculously, for the third straight time, Kent recorded the pin, leaving the worldâs most famous arena Friday night on a ridiculous streak. On Saturday morning, Kent got right back to business, downing No. 12 Nathan Jackson, 9-5, to earn a spot in the consolation finals. The win, his sixth of the tournament, tied the Penn record for most victories in one NCAA tournament.      Kentâs final matchup of the weekend, his eighth bout in three days, was a rematch of his opening face-off with Epperly, who was riding an impressive streak of his own to avoid elimination. Unfortunately for Kent, he couldnât upset the Virginia Tech stud again and settled for fourth place after an 8-4 decision. Kent, who will be returning to the program next season to use his final year of eligibility, will get another crack at the field next year when the tournament moves to St. Louis. Thomas, however, wrestled his final match for the Red and Blue after an incredible four seasons. His sixth place finish in 2014 was the highlight of a 113-win career for the Pittsburgh native. 157-pound sophomore May Bethea and 133-pound junior Caleb Richardson also made the trip to New York. Bethea won his first match but lost his next two, and Richardson failed to advance past the first day of competition. Both will return next season. âEveryone just really wants All-American,â Kent said. âAll the matches are really hard, so I just went out and I just tried to wrestle as hard as I can.â The unseeded Kent never gave up, and finished the season recognized as one of the nationâs best.  \n",

            "With dual season nearing its close, Penn wrestling is looking to kick into high gear.For one more weekend, the Quakers (4-6, 2-5 EIWA) will have a loaded slate with little rest in between. After six straight weeks of having a tournament or multiple duals, the Red and Blue will head into one final grueling weekend â starting on Friday with Cornell and continuing into Saturday with trips to Binghamton and Columbia â before dual season comes to a close the following weekend against Drexel.With all three matches this weekend being against conference opponents, the team has little margin for error. Penn has fared well in its last few matches in the EIWA, winning two and narrowly losing to Brown. The Quakers will look to keep their winning ways alive against two strong programs in Binghamton and Columbia and one of the nationâs wrestling behemoths in Cornell.Over the course of the dual season, familiar faces, especially those in the middle weight classes, continue to deliver points for the Quakers. Unsurprisingly, the three uninjured captains have played a consistent and important role in that development.Junior captain Joe Oliva has wrestled to a 6-4 dual record at 149 pounds. Junior captain May Bethea is having another dominant season at 157 pounds, holding a 9-2 record against EIWA opponents, and looks primed for another run at the conference tournament in March. Finally, senior captain Brooks Martino has split a starting role with junior Joe Velliquette lately, but has won his last three. Heâs looking for another shot at nationals after qualifying in 2015.There are also big point-scorers in the higher weight classes. 2016 All-American and senior Casey Kent is having another banner year at 174, going 5-2 in conference. Junior 184-pounder Joe Heyob had been tearing through opponents in his six-match winning streak before coming up short against Brown. His success is all the more surprising given that he dropped from 197 to 184 last month. At 197, senior Frank Mattiace has outscored his opponents 76-24 and could be the Red and Blueâs best shot at earning All-American honors in 2017.Those accomplishments are certainly impressive, but all six wrestlers will need to be at their best this weekend against Cornell. The Big Red (10-2, 3-0) are the tenth-ranked program in the nation at the moment and have steamrolled through their opponents, with their only losses against No. 2 Oklahoma State and No. 7 Missouri.The Red and Blue are determined to give the Bears trouble on Friday, though. Mattiace, No. 17 at 197, will wrestle Cornellâs No. 19 Owen Scott. The two wrestled at the Southern Scuffle last month, when Mattiace picked up a narrow 4-3 decision. The Montville, N.J. native is looking to focus on his own wrestling heading into the weekend.âItâs important to just have the right mindset the week of practice,â Mattiace said. âKeep your goals in mind and what you are focusing on.âAt 174, No. 3 Kent will wrestle Cornellâs No. 3 Brian Realbuto. Both grapplers scored a victory against the other last season and have wrestled close against one another. This encounter is expected to be no different.After that, Cornell will unleash its nationally revered 184-pounder, Gabe Dean. The senior has been a wrecking ball in his time in Ithaca. His rivalry with Pennâs Lorenzo Thomas (Câ16), also an All-American, was always a marquee matchup between the two schools. This year, Dean will likely take on Heyob. Dean is 24-0 on the year and has pinned 18 of his opponents. In his time at Cornell, heâs 141-6 and a two-time NCAA Champion. Surely, Heyob will need to utilize his entire arsenal.The Big Red lineup is stacked from top to bottom, but the Quakers are excited to play spoiler to their rivalâs impressive season. Bethea is well aware of Cornellâs success and that has only helped to motivate him. He stresses how excited his teammates are given the exciting rivalry the two schools have.â[With it] being Cornell, weâre motivated . . . weâre huge rivals,â Bethea said. âWeâve been excited this whole week to wrestle them.âCoach Alex Tirapelle echoed Betheaâs words, mentioning that the team has been geared up for Cornell for weeks.âItâs one they look forward to,â Tirapelle said. âThey do know where itâs at on the schedule so they get amped up and hyped up. Nowâs the time we can cut them loose a little bit and get them excited for the match.âCornell is a daunting challenge and just the first leg of a three-match weekend. On Saturday, the Quakers will continue onwards against Binghamton (8-4, 8-2) and then Columbia (3-9, 1-4). The key to the weekend is thinking one match at a time.âIn terms of the amount of wrestling, itâs no different than being in a tournament,â Mattiace said. âIn terms of being focused, itâs important that you focus on the match at hand, and once thatâs over with, you can start focusing on the next one.âAll told, this weekend is another crucial one for the Quakers and one of the last impressions that the teamâs NCAA hopefuls can make heading into the conference tournament.\n",

            "Updated May 23 3 p.m. TOWSON, Md., May 22 - Penn almost pulled off one the biggest comebacks in NCAA history, yet fell just short of the incredible. Down 11-7 with 9:14 to go in the NCAA national semifinal against No. 1 Northwestern, the No. 4 Quakers tallied four straight goals, sending the game into overtime.  In overtime freshman Erin Brennan scored with just 10 seconds left in the first half, but since it was not a sudden death round, Northwestern still had a shot. Winning the draw, the Wildcats pushed the ball up, eventually getting a shot off with roughly two seconds left. But goalkeeper Emily Szelest saved it. However, NU's Katrina Dowd somehow managed to knock the rebound in despite being on her knees, right as time expired. Then in the second overtime, which is a sudden death round, Meredith Frank scored the winning goal with 1:31 left as Penn lost, 13-12. The Wildcats (22-0) have won the last four national championships, and will get the chance for number five tomorrow against No. 3 North Carolina who upset No. 2 Maryland, 8-7, in the other semifinals. \"Kudos to Penn,\" Northwestern coach Kelly Amonte-Hiller said. \"That game was definitely a thriller.\" Junior Ali DeLuca led the Quakers (15-3) with four goals and an assist, but the player of the game was Dowd, who scored four of her own, including that shot from her knees at the end of the first half of overtime when she flicked the ball over her head and into the net as time expired.  \"I knew there wasn't much time left so I just swung at the ball and tapped it,\" the junior said. \"It was a hockey-like goal. . Honestly, I had no idea where the ball was going when I shot the ball.\" Penn was equally dumbfounded the goal went in. \"Nothing against her, but I think it was a lot of luck,\" Penn senior defense Katie Mazer said. \"It was an unbelievable shot.\" In addition to being an incredible display of athleticism as well as saving Northwestern's season, the goal gave her 18 for this tournament - with still one more game to play - setting a new NCAA Tournament record. The previous 17-goal mark was shared by Dowd's teammate Hilary Bowen in 2008 and Delaware's Karen Emas in 1984. \"Breaking the record in a game we won makes it more memorable so I can enjoy it, thanks to Meredith [Frank],\" Dowd said. \"If we had lost, the record wouldn't have meant anything to me.\" Just the fact that Northwestern had to rely on a circus shot to keep alive of its hopes of continuing the championship streak was remarkable. Penn had only beaten the Wildcats once in the last seven matchups, including an 11-9 loss in Evanston, Ill., earlier this season. Several times in this game it looked like the Quakers were simply overmatched. They gave up three quick goals in the game's first five minutes, and after trading goals, found themselves down 4-1 with less than 17 minutes left in the first half.  Although they'd cut their deficit down to just one at halftime, the Quakers couldn't cut the lead anymore in the second half, as it seemed anytime Penn would score, Northwestern would counter on the next possession. Then when Danielle Spencer scored her third goal of the game with 9:14 left to make it an 11-7 game, all 7,549 spectators thought that Penn was done. But the team still had confidence they could come back. \"We've been behind this year so I never thought the game was getting away from us,\" Penn coach Karin Brower said. \"I have so much faith in them because they never give up.\" With 6:22 left, senior Samantha Bird earned a free position shot, and netted the ball past Northwestern goalkeeper Morgan Lathrop. After the next draw went NU's way, the Quakers caused a turnover and marched down the field, with DeLuca ripping off a monster shot for her fourth goal with just 3:01 remaining. That goal gave her both 40 for the season and 100 for her career. But the Quakers weren't done yet, as they still need two goals to force overtime. They got those goals off another free position shot from sophomore Giulia Giordano and then Bird again off a Giordano assist. \"We were able to stay calm and be a cohesive unit on attack,\" DeLuca said of the charge to tie it up. In overtime, Northwestern won the draw, and tried to wait out the clock. But Penn eventually caused a turnover and stormed down the field. Then with 10.8 seconds remaining, Brennan scored the go-ahead goal on a bouncing shot. \"She's been great for us,\" Brower said of her Ivy League Rookie of the Year. \"She's one of the most exciting players that we have.\"  \"She's a rock star,\" Mazer added. Rock star or not, Brennan soon lost the spotlight to Dowd and her aerobatic goal.  So Brennan finished her rookie campaign with the taste of heartbreaking defeat at the hands of the Wildcats, something which has happened to Penn in each of the last three seasons on the final weekend. Two years ago they were trounced 12-2 in the semifinals at Franklin Field, and then last year they lost, 10-6, at the same Johnny Unitas Stadium where they almost pulled off a great comeback. But for Northwestern, they were just happy to pull out the most exciting win of the year. \"I'm really happy for what happened today since we'll appreciate Sunday,\" Amonte-Hiller said. \"We knew [the Quakers] weren't going to roll over, so we were ready for anything.\" Well thanks to Dowd's miracle shot, anything except losing.\n",

            "Penn wrestling had a roller coaster ride on the mat in a weekend series of three dual meets. On Saturday at the Palestra, the Quakers lost to No. 19 Princeton, 28-6, but followed that up with a 39-0 victory against California Baptist on Sunday afternoon. Penn then headed up to Franklin & Marshall, a road meet which ended with a score of 30-6 in favor of the Red and Blue. To kick off the weekend against Princeton (8-6, 4-1 Ivy), two nationally-ranked freshmen at 125 pounds, Penn's Carmen Ferrante and the Tigers' Patrick Glory, wrestled in an anticipated matchup. The first part of the match was tightly contested until Glory pulled ahead with several consecutive takedowns. With two minutes and 22 seconds of riding time, Glory secured the 10-3 victory to hand Ferrante his first dual-meet loss of the season and put the Quakers (5-8, 2-3 Ivy) in an early hole.  âIt was a really good experience for [Carmen] to compete against Glory; theyâll likely meet in the EIWA championships again,â coach Roger Reina said. At 285 pounds, freshman Ben Goldin clocked two minutes and 31 seconds of riding time and defeated Princetonâs Kendall Elfstrum by decision to complete a 4-0 shutout. âOur team motto is resilience, and no matter what happens, or what the score is, just going in to fight every match, every position,â Goldin said. âWe are always staying positive and hoping to win the next one.â Another important showdown was between freshman Anthony Artalona and Princetonâs Matthew Kolodzik at 149 pounds. In the second period, Artalona pulled ahead with a takedown, which Kolodzik immediately returned. With the score tied at 5-5 late in the third, Kolodzik won two straight points and pinned Artalona to win the match, 7-5.  Yet another freshman, Doug Zapf, posted three wins this weekend at 133 and 141 pounds, beginning with his 1-0 victory against Princetonâs Jonathan Gomez, a match the two wrestlers played almost entirely on their feet. The slow match saw no points in the first or third periods, and a single escape point for Zapf in the second period resulted in his victory. âItâs fun to go back-to-back-to-back, just picking up little things from each match about what you can do better on,â Zapf said. In his match against Cal Baptist (2-4), with the score tied at 0 midway through the second period, Zapf and his opponent, sophomore Adam Velasquez, scored points back and forth until the score was 5-2. At that point, Zapf posted multiple consecutive takedowns while holding Velasquez below five points. The match resulted in a 12-4 Zapf victory by major decision.  âIâve been putting it more together [lately] and still sometimes struggle with getting to my offense, so thatâs what Iâve been trying to focus on a lot,â Zapf said. \"I did better with it today [against Cal Baptist], and so itâs just about working a lot harder and just trying to keep growing.â Overall, the Quakers dominated the Lancers, winning matches in every weight class. Ferrante, for his part, opened the meet with a 15-0 win.  âWe are encouraging our guys to generate more offense, to be more offensive, to continue to score with a lead,â Reina said. âThatâs really important this time of year in the postseason, to not be just satisfied with a lead but continue to build on it, so that was an important step forward for us.â At 174 pounds, Jake Hendricks secured three consecutive takedowns in the first period alone. At one point, it looked like Cal Baptist had the opportunity to pin Hendricks, but the freshman flipped the script and maintained control until the match ended with a score of 7-4. Senior Robert Ng, who lost his 184-pound match against Princeton's Kevin Parker on Saturday, defeated the Lancers' Garrett Strang in overtime on Sunday. Ng led for the majority of the match, but in the last 15 seconds Strang scored a two-point pin, sending the match into overtime. However, Ng pulled away in extra time and captured a 5-3 victory. To finish the weekend, Penn handled Franklin & Marshall on Sunday night, winning eight of its 10 matches. Artalona got things going with a 9-6 victory over Patrick Quinlan. The Red and Blue won the next four matches to give themselves a comfortable lead. To end the night, Zapf continued his strong weekend performance, narrowly defeating Diplomats' sophomore Haroldo Nesbeth by a 7-6 margin. Next Sunday, the Quakers will take on Lehigh, which will be their final match before the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association Championships in March.\n",

            "Any team is liable to have some jitters on opening night. That said, even the most extreme cases are cured by capturing two wins to start the season. After initially struggling to find an offensive rhythm in matches against James Madison and Temple, the Penn womenâs soccer team ultimately delivered at Rhodes Field and defeated both opponents, 2-1 and 2-0, respectively. The games, against the Dukes on Friday and the Owls on Sunday, featured the return of 2010 ECAC and Ivy League Rookie of the Year Kerry Scalora, who suffered a season-ending injury last fall. Now a junior, Scalora punctuated her journey through rehabilitation with a dramatic conclusion: scoring the game-winning goal against James Madison (2-2). âRight before the game, I was so nervous because I havenât been on the field in a while â¦ once I saw the goal go in the back of the net, I was just like, âTake me off the field, I want to cry,ââ Scalora said. âIt meant that much to me.â The weekend also saw two Penn players, juniors Laura Oliver and Claire Walker, tally the first goals of their careers. Oliverâs goal came in the first half against James Madison, just 27 seconds after the Dukes took a 1-0 lead. Making her first touch of the game, Oliver knocked a cross from the right side off the goal post and into the net. All signs point to an increase in Oliverâs impact on the Quakersâ offense this season, especially as she plays more aggressively near the goal. âSheâs becoming more and more of an attacking oriented player,â coach Darren Ambrose said. âSheâs got the skill, she has the speed, but she doesnât impose herself upon the game. When she does, look out.â Meanwhile, on the defensive end, junior back Brianna Rano competed against her younger sister Shannon, a sophomore defender for James Madison. While Shannon notched the Dukesâ only goal, Brianna walked away with the win and managed to tackle her sister at least once, despite playing on opposite ends of the field. âThat was the highlight of the game for me,â Brianna said with a laugh. Against Temple (1-3-1) on Sunday, Brianna scored a goal of her own â the first of the game â when she lined up a long free kick on the right side and struck the ball in a high arc that curved toward the far post. While the free kick failed to connect with any of her teammates, it did manage to find the back of the net after the Temple defense misplayed it. âI actually overhit it a little. I kind of was aiming to put in on somebodyâs head,â Brianna said. âIt wound up just going right into the corner instead, so I was happy.â Later in the match, Brianna attempted to repeat her performance on an eerily similar free kick and pegged the shot off the top of the goal post. No score on the weekend was more crucial or emotionally charged than Scaloraâs goal in the 65th minute against James Madison. With the game tied, 1-1, Scalora gathered a corner kick at the top of the penalty area, took a touch to her left and drilled a shot between the legs of a defender into the right corner of the goal. Defense was the focal point of last yearâs Penn squad, which held its opponents to just seven goals in 17 games and led the nation in shutout percentage. This yearâs backline, led by Rano, sophomore Haley Cooper and seniors Erin Thayer and Alex Dayneka, played as if nothing has changed. Pennâs defense conceded just 12 shots on the weekend and was rarely challenged. Senior goalkeeper Sarah Banks was an active voice in the back and could be heard directing traffic throughout the games. While the defense had only a few miscues, the offense required more time to develop a rhythm. At the start of both matches, Pennâs offense seemed out of sync, playing frantically at times and struggling to control possessions beyond a couple of passes. However, as the games wore on, the team showed progressively sharper tactical skill. âWhen it became a soccer game and not a track meet, then I think it played to what we do, which is knock it around and create chances,â Ambrose said. In the second half against Temple, several Quakers â including Scalora, Oliver and sophomores Clara Midgley and Megan York â made effective runs against the Owls defense, leading to 12 shots. By comparison, Temple got off just three shots in the entire game. Despite the shot advantage, Ambrose would like to see the offense demonstrate more determination and aggression in the final third of the field. âWe want to see two or three players step up and impose themselves and really take over the game from an attacking standpoint,â Ambrose said.

            "Penn women's soccer clearly didn't mind the rain, as they managed to take all six points in a wet, windy weekend.  The Red and Blue continued their impressive season by beating Delaware 2-0 on Friday and Navy 4-2 on Sunday in convincing fashion despite the difficult weather conditions. The Quakers (4-1) made three lineup changes going into their opening match, switching two of their three forwards after their close loss to No. 13 NC State. âEveryone knows what our objectives are and everyone accepts whatever role theyâre given on the day,â coach Nicole Van Dyke said. âAnd that really contributed to two wins this weekend.â  The Quakers got off to a hot start against the Blue Hens (1-5-1), forcing four shots and three corner kicks in the first couple of minutes.  This pressure led to the first breakthrough for the Red and Blue, a direct goal off a corner kick from senior Sasha Stephens in the fifth minute. The forward took a corner kick, using an in-swinging curve to beat the opposing goalkeeper in the upper-90. This momentum set the tone for the rest of the first half. Penn tacked on six more shots in the next fifteen minutes, continuing to keep the pressure on Delaware. The game continued in this manner until the Quakers found their second breakthrough. Freshman forward Jackie Bruder scored the first goal of her collegiate career, following a beautiful assist from senior Allie Trzaska in the 27th minute. Delaware responded with their first shot on goal in the game coming in the 31st minute that was easily handled by junior goalkeeper Kitty Qu.  âI donât think thereâs one thing that contributes to the success of our backline,â Qu said. âJust constant communication, always staying focus no matter what the circumstances are, and adapting to whatever our opponent gives us.â Solid defense allowed Penn to preserve the clean sheet, its third already this year.  âThe main thing is that our backline is not that young anymore,â Qu said. âHaving that time together has really helped us solidify everything defensively in terms of organization and staying together.â The team was looking to keep up this run when they faced a tough Navy squad playing on their home turf. To make things tougher, a constant downpour and heavy winds led to very difficult playing conditions. âItâs obviously a challenge to play under these conditions, but what I love about this team is the resilience we have,â Qu said. The tone of the match at the onset was different from Pennâs previous match. Two shots on target by Navy (2-3-3) and two corners in the first three minutes forced Penn on its back foot.  The Quakers quickly turned the tide, though, following up with two shots on goal of their own. The second of which was placed into the back of the net by Stephens â her second goal in as many games â via a cross from junior forward Emily Sands. Penn could not capitalize on their next few chances before a tackle outside of the defensive box led to a free kick opportunity for Navy's Basely McClaskey. She then stepped up and fired her shot past Qu in the 28th minute.  With the game looking like it would go into the break all tied up, Kelsey Andrewsâ looping shot found the back of the goal to give the Red and Blue the lead in the 38th minute. The goal came from yet another Trzaska assist. This was the fifth assist of the season for the midfielder, which leads the team. âTo go a goal up, [Navy] equalize, and the response we had in that moment was to get after it again, I was super proud,â Van Dyke said.  The Midshipmen earned a great chance to equalize, but their shot was cleared off the goal line by sophomore defender Chase Geffert.  After the Quaker defense turned away threatening shots, Geffert had two chances from free kicks, a shot being tipped over the bar and a pass to Sands that was narrowly wide. The pressure led to an insurance goal for Penn as Sands put in her second goal of the season. Navy attempted to clear the ball from its box, but Sands intercepted it and fired it to the back of the net.  With the game winding down, junior forward Emma Loving seemed to have scored the gameâs final goal in the 89th minute coming off an assist from Bruder.  However, 17 seconds later, Navy earned another free kick, and McClaskey scored off the direct kick for the second time in the game. This was also double the amount of goals that the Red and Blue had allowed all season. âThis team really, truly is all in and has a lot of belief in everyone,â Van Dyke said. âTheyâre excited to see each other have success, and thatâs something special that we need to continue to build on.â The Quakers have one more weekend of non-conference play to look forward to before their conference season starts. With multiple players stepping up offensively and the defensive unit continuing to perform, Penn looks like an Ivy League contender.\n",

            "Casey Kent's long road back to wrestling heads toward NCAA finaleAfter watching his teammates struggle on the second day of the NCAA wrestling championships, 174-pounder Casey Kent made his opponents pay. Big time.The Norristown, Pa., native finished with four wins of Friday, three by pin and one by major decision, en route to All-American honors and a spot in the consolation semifinals on Saturday morning.Going into day two, there had been a lot of optimism following a very successful first day for the Quakers. But, after two matches and two losses, any momentum that the Quakers brought into the building from their impressive opening performance was suddenly gone.First sophomore 157-pounder May Bethea lost a closely contested 7-4 decision in the wrestlebacks.Almost immediately thereafter 184-pound senior Lorenzo Thomas stepped up to take on Willie Miklus of Missouri in a quarterfinal matchup between former All-Americans.Thomas and Milkus met in the first round of the national tournament last season where Thomas built a 4-2 lead before Milkus came back and stuck him with a pin.For the second straight year Thomas again built a 4-2 lead after the first period, taking down Milkus with relative ease. Somewhat surprisingly, Thomas chose to start on bottom in the second period despite his success on his feet.That proved to his downfall.Thomas failed to notch the quick escape and Milkus made him pay with a four-point nearfall cradle to take a 6-4 lead. After that Thomas couldnât regain his footing and ultimately lost, 16-6.Then came Casey Kent.The senior 174-pounder entered his first consolation bout, against South Dakota Stateâs David Kocher, as the Red and Blueâs last chance to grab a victory before the night session.Kent, who had already upset eighth-seeded Zach Epperly of Virginia Tech in the first round on Thursday, was fighting to stay alive in the wrestlebacks.Right from the start it was clear that the pace of the match, and consequently the final score, was going to be determined by Kent.He dominated his opponent, David Kocer of South Dakota State, from start to finish, earning an 8-0 major decision victory.Because Kent began the day in the loserâs bracket he had to grapple for a second time in the afternoon session, and this time his foe didnât go down so easy.No. 16 Micah Barnes of Nebraska, who also secured a win by major decision in his first bout of the day, awaited the unseeded Kent.Barnes was the aggressor from the opening whistle, jumping out to an 8-1 lead in the first period after nearly pinning Kent.By the time the third period began Kent was still down big, 10-3, and in need of a miracle.After 30 seconds he got one.The two wrestlers were on their feet with their arms tied up when Kent shifted his weight and flipped Barnes off his feet and on to his back in a swift motion that sent the big Cornhusker slamming to the mat.The move, which seemed to appear out of thin air, caught Barnes, as well as everyone else in the arena besides Kent, by surprise.That decision ignited a fire under the senior, who rode the wave into the night session.Thomas would join Kent in the second session but unfortunately he was pinned by Navyâs Mathew Miller just as Kent was competing in his blood round match.As Thomas fell, Kent picked up right where he left of against Oklahomaâs Matt Reed â only this time he dominated from the start.Up 3-0 in the third period Kent stuck the Reed for the fall and became Pennâs first All-American since Thomas in 2014.Only 30 minutes later Kent was back out on the mat, wrestling seventh-seeded Cody Walters of Ohio.Miraculously, for the third straight time, Kent recorded the pin, leaving the Worldâs Most Famous Arena on a ridiculous streak.Tomorrow Kent will test his luck in the consolation semifinals which will determine whether he wrestles for third or fifth in the afternoon. Regardless, heâs an All-American, and no matter what he just together a performance for the ages.\n",

            "They just ran out of time. After launching a furious second-half comeback, Penn womenâs lacrosse fell just short of an Ivy League Tournament title on Sunday.The tournamentâs No. 1 seed, the Red and Blue hosted third-seeded Cornell two days after an overtime win over Harvard. Sundayâs contest wouldnât need the extra minutes, however, as the Big Red took advantage of an early lead to knock off the Quakers, 11-10.Seeking to avenge a loss at the hands of the Red and Blue (13-4, 6-1 Ivy) last weekend, Cornell (13-4, 5-2) came out firing, jumping out to a 2-0 lead in the gameâs opening five minutes. Sophomore attack Caroline Cummings got Penn on the board after six and a half minutes with an unassisted goal to make it 2-1.The Big Red responded with another pair of goals, however, putting the Quakers behind the 8-ball early as they brought the lead to 4-1. It seemed like the Red and Blue might take control back of the game, however, as junior goalkeeper Britt Brown saved a shot from Cornellâs Emily Tripodi before Penn senior attack Catherine Dickinson found the net off an assist from her classmate, Nina Corcoran.The momentum would not stay with the hosts for long. Barely a minute after Dickinsonâs goal, Joey Coffy netted another one for the Big Red, making it 5-2. Close on the heels of that goal was another for the visitors, making it 6-2 with 17 minutes remaining in the first half.A goal from Corcoran cut the deficit to 6-3, but the Quakers continue their 2-to-1 trade-off, conceding two more goals as the opening half came to a close, going into the break trailing, 8-3.Entering the second half, the Red and Blue came out firing. Sophomore Alex Condon scored for Penn on an assist from Corcoran to make it 8-4. With the assist, Corcoran broke the Ivy League single-season assist record, putting her total at 51 for the year and five away from the career record. She finished the day with two goals and three assists in an effort to take over the game late and close the early deficit.âItâs obviously a goal that Iâve had for the season, but right now itâs kind of hard to soak it in,â Corcoran noted. âItâs a tough loss. But I wouldnât have been able to have gotten it without my teammates, so a lot of credit goes to them.ââSheâs a tremendous player, one of the best players Iâve ever coached,â Penn coach Karin Corbett added. Iâm proud of her, I donât think she cares about that record right now, but she is the reason that we came back, sheâs the reason that we are where we are.âOnce again, the Big Red responded as Catherine Ellis made it a 9-4 game. Although Penn won the faceoff after struggling on the draw early on â the Quakers won only one of 11 faceoffs in the first half â a quick turnover gave the Big Red possession and Tripodi quickly converted it into a score, setting Pennâs deficit at six.Then, things got interesting. Down 10-4 with 20 minutes to play, the Quakers roared back to life. Over the next nine minutes, Dickinson, Condon, Williamson, Cummings and Corcoran all found the net as the Red and Blue scored five unanswered goals to make it 10-9. âWe started getting the ball more on the draw. We werenât winning it in the first half, and you canât win the game without the ball in your stick,â Corcoran said. âIt was all about heart at that point. We knew we could attack and score once we got the ball, but we just needed to make that change of getting the ball in our hands.âCorcoran also added an assist during that stretch, bringing her record-breaking season total to 52.âNina is a true competitor, and I think she puts this team on her back a lot and she lives the losses,â Corbett said. âShe carries the losses hard and she learns from her mistakes, but she is the heart and soul of this team. And she really showed that today. âItâs hard for someone like Nina to see that first half, frustration of not seeing the ball, but as you saw once we got the ball, Nina took over and ran this attack and allowed us that opportunity to come back.âCornell finally managed to stop the bleeding on a Tripodi goal with 7:38 to play, but this time it was the Quakersâ turn to respond. With six minutes remaining, Condon found the net for a third time on the day, making it 11-10 as the Red and Blue sought to complete the comeback.On the subsequent draw, the Big Red won possession and managed to wind the clock down before Penn got the ball with a minute remaining.Corbett called a time out with 47 seconds to go, and her team prepared for one final attempt at tying the game. Corcoran got a shot off, but it was no good and Cornell got possession back as the final seconds ticked off the clock.âWe did start to come back, and I also think we had some opportunities to win the game,â Corbett said. âWe shot poorly. Unfortunately, you put yourself in a hole that way defensively and then every shot matters and so every shot is magnified as a bad shot or, like, âWhy did I take that shot?â We just shouldnât have been in that hole in the first place. Our defense has to play better going into NCAAs.âAlthough the loss means the Quakers will not get an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, their season is likely not yet over. The 10th-ranked team in the country, Penn stands in a strong position to earn an at-large bid to the tournament when the field is announced later on Sunday.\n",

            "In a weekend filled with both triumphs and disappointments, senior Bryan Ortenzio punctuated Pennâs trip to the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association Championships by capturing the conference title at 133 pounds. The squad finished fourth overall in the tournament held at Princetonâs Jadwin Gymnasium on March 3-4 and will send five wrestlers to the NCAA Championships this weekend in St. Louis. Experience distinguished Ortenzio in his opening three matches, as he faced two freshmen and one sophomore. In particular, experience gave him the upper hand in the semifinals against No. 3 seed Mason Beckman, a freshman from Lehigh. Despite posting an impressive 26-9 record this season, Beckman wrestled a bit like a âdeer in the headlights,â Ortenzio said, as the senior secured a 4-1 victory and advanced to the final. âI was calm and collected and able to use my experience to my advantage,â said Ortenzio, who defeated Navy senior Aaron Kalil, 2-1, in the title match. The individual championship ended a drought for Penn dating back to 2008, when the Quakers took home three EIWA titles. In addition to Ortenzioâs victory, senior Micah Burak also advanced to the final, where he faced Cornellâs Cam Simaz for the third consecutive year. As the nationâs top wrestler in the 197-pound weightclass, Simaz had defeated Burak in all eight of their previous meetings. However, the score was 4-3 in the third period of the final, before Simaz ultimately shot ahead of Burak and won, 9-4. While not a win, the match was an encouraging sign for Burakâs ability to challenge Simaz in the national championship tournament next weekend. âIf thatâs the only time weâre ever going to beat Simaz, Iâd rather have it [at NCAAs] than in a dual meet or the conference tournament,â coach Rob Eiter said. Unseeded senior Erich Smith was wrestling to keep his collegiate career alive, as he needed at least a fourth place finish to advance to the NCAA tournament. After losing his opening match, Smith rebounded to win four consecutive matches, which earned him third place and an automatic spot in NCAAs. Along the way, Smith avenged two losses from earlier in the season, including a defeat on Pennâs senior night to Columbiaâs Shane Hughes. âIâve never seen him turn it on like that before,â said Ortenzio, who called Smith the âmost valuable wrestlerâ for the weekend. No. 1 seed Zack Kemmerer missed an opportunity at an EIWA title, losing in the semifinals to Americanâs Matt Mariarcher. Up 2-1 in the second period, Kemmerer was wrestling well before his elimination by a contentious neutral fall. The senior was unable to respond in the semifinal consolation, losing a second match, before rounding out the weekend with a win in the fifth-place match. Eiter noted that Kemmerer can learn from his experience at the EIWA tournament to propel him to a better performance at the national championships. âI think Zack learned from that second loss that he just didnât attack as much. He canât just attack one time and expect to get the takedown every single time. Itâs a matter of odds,â Eiter said. âIf you shoot five, six, seven times, youâre going to come away with at least one takedown.â The four wrestlers booked their tickets to NCAAs and will be joined by freshman Steve Robertson, who earned an automatic bid to the national tournament with a fifth-place finish in the 149-pound bracket. The five members from the squad want to carry their lessons and momentum from EIWAs into next weekend. âThat conference championship is just one step along the way to the ultimate goal of becoming a national champion,â Ortenzio said. âI think weâre going to make some noise out in St. Louis.â\n",

            "As Joe Biden emerged from Super Tuesday as the Democratic presidential primary frontrunner, on-campus political groups began preparing for a brutal competition between the former Penn Presidential Professor of Practice and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).  Students running Penn for Biden said they anticipate a close race, and despite the setback, Penn for Bernie remains determined to secure their candidate's nomination. As the two candidates double down on their campaign efforts, both Penn for Biden and Penn for Bernie will do the same â phone-banking, door-knocking, and hosting events for their presidential favorites.  Super Tuesday revealed the two obvious presidential frontrunners for the Democratic primary were Biden and Sanders. The former vice president emerged from the nation's most consequential primary day with the majority vote across numerous Southern states, as well as in Texas, Minnesota, and Massachusetts, while Sanders was victorious in Vermont, Utah, Colorado, and the delegate-rich state of California.  Biden currently leads with 529 total delegates, with Sanders following closely behind with 455. Either will need 1,991 delegates to secure the party's presidential nomination, and 13 states have yet to hold primaries.  Penn for Biden Co-founder and Wharton senior Dylan Milligan is optimistic Biden's Super Tuesday successes show Biden holds the widest appeal among Americans, especially older voters of color and more moderate Democrats. \"Biden definitely exceeded expectations by all measures,\" Milligan said. \"He proved that he can build a coalition thatâs incredibly broad, not just amongst his solid base of voters primarily in the South â he also picked up that surprise victory in Massachusetts and Minnesota.\" Penn for Biden Co-founder and College senior Gabriel Barnett said Biden's Tuesday victories show that he is the best candidate to defeat Republican incumbent and 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump. \"[Biden's supporters] trust him to beat Donald Trump, to keep the House, to be the person at the top of the ticket to win the Senate, and to get results in Washington,\" Barnett said. Despite their optimism, Milligan and Barnett do not think Biden's win will be an easy one. \"Going forward, thereâs still a big race up ahead,\" Milligan said. \"I anticipate it being quite competitive, given that Sanders, if anything, is a persistent man. So weâre going to focus on turning out voters who support Biden in the Pennsylvania primary.â  Penn for Bernie Co-director and College sophomore Jack Cahill said the group is not deterred by Sanders' setbacks, even though the Senator himself expressed frustration in the lack of Super Tuesday youth voter turnout. âAll the students for Bernie groups Iâve talked to are still very energized, still very excited, and not at all stalled in terms of the energy that they are going to bring in the future,\" Cahill said. \"Itâs obviously going to be a much longer fight than what we had hoped it would be just two weeks ago â weâre definitely ready for it.\"   Penn for Bernie Co-director and College sophomore Amira Chowdhury is confident Sanders' progressive ideas will give him the youth vote in the upcoming primaries, and eventually in the November race against Trump.  âSanders is still the only candidate who has the strongest appeal to the youth vote.\" she said. âBernieâs track record of staying committed to the material interests of the vast majority of Americans has always been the same, whereas Bidenâs have always been about political calculations.\" Cahill agreed with Chowdhury, and said the group is ready to fight for Sanders until the end. âWeâre going to continue doing weekly canvasses, phone banks, holding watch parties and weâre going to be right there until Bernie Sanders wins the nomination and defeats Donald Trump.â Cahill said that he hopes Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) will endorse Sanders and add momentum to his campaign. But despite Warren's disappointing Super Tuesday performance, the senator has not left the race â and neither has Penn for Warren.  The group's Membership Director Borna Saeednia said the group will continue to campaign for Warren as long as she stays in the race. The former Penn Law School professor did not win any state majorities on Tuesday, and came in third place in her home state of Massachusetts.  \"We are not discouraged by the results and will strongly support Sen. Warren in the upcoming races,\" Saeednia said. Penn for Pete, the fourth of Penn's on-campus political interest groups, no longer formally exists since the former South Bend, Ind. mayor dropped out the race last week and pledged his support to Biden. Although Buttigieg endorsed Biden, Penn for Pete will not officially endorse anyone, as club members prefer different candidates, Wharton sophomore and co-coordinator of Penn for Pete Manoj Simha said. Simha said the club wants to see Buttigiegâs platform embraced by the front-running candidates. âParticularly because heâs endorsed the Biden campaign, we are hoping to see a lot of the things that Pete was talking about in terms for the vision for the future of the Democratic Party being embraced by Biden,â Simha said. As the April 28 Pennsylvania primary approaches, Penn Leads the Vote, a nonpartisan organization on campus, hopes to empower student voters to make their voices heard in the swing state. Penn Leads the Vote Director Harrison Feinman said he found the low voter turnout on Super Tuesday to be disheartening, especially on college campuses. \"There were stories of four hour-plus wait lines that really showed that a lot of students do try to get involved, but there are still barriers,\" he said. Staff reporters Tori Sousa and Kami Houston contributed reporting. \n",

            "On Tuesday, Pennsylvania voters will wait in lines and check off names as they weigh in on the 2016 presidential nomination. Unlike in previous years, the Pennsylvania primary carries unusual weight because neither party has a candidate that has obtained a majority of the necessary delegates. The real race will take place on the bottom of the Republican ballot, where voters will directly select delegates, almost 80 percent of whom are unpledged.The Democratic Primary:The Democratic Party primary is relatively straightforward. Statewide winners get a number of delegates in proportion to how they did in the popular voting. Of the 189 delegates at stake in Pennsylvania, 127 are handed out based on the results in individual Congressional districts, while 62 are pledged based on statewide totals. Pennsylvania also has superdelegates â consisting of party officials, former and current Democratic politicians â who vote for candidates independent of the popular vote.Of the 21 superdelegates in the state, at least 18 of them are pledged to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, The Boston Globe reported in an April 21 article.According to The Associated Press, Clinton has 275 more delegates and 477 more superdelegates than Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). If Sanders won every delegate in both Pennsylvania and Maryland, which also votes on Tuesday, he could close the delegate gap.But that seems unlikely since an April 20 poll conducted by Monmouth University found Clinton leading by about 13 points in Pennsylvania. Because of proportional delegation, Sanders would have to win more than 85 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania to close the delegate gap.The Republican Primary:The Pennsylvania GOP primary, on the other hand, is one of the strangest primary elections in the country. In Pennsylvania, there are 71 GOP delegates, but 54 are directly elected by Pennsylvania voters. The rest of the delegates are obligated to adhere to the results of the primary for at least the first round of voting at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this July.No other state leaves so many of its delegates unbound. Stranger still, the ballot includes no guidance on which candidate the delegate will commit to at the national convention.On the primary ballot, a Pennsylvanian voter can cast a vote for a presidential candidate and for delegate candidates to go to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this July. Each Congressional district must pick among the available delegate candidates for three representatives to send to the RNC.If a Republican enters a voting booth in Pennsylvaniaâs 2nd district, which includes Pennâs campus, they would see four delegates â Aaron Cohen, Aldridk Gessa, Elizabeth Havey and Calvin Tucker â but would receive no guidance on who the delegates support. Gessa has voluntarily pledged to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Cohen and Tucker are uncommitted and Havey has said she will vote for whomever wins the district popular vote.At least 50 other delegate candidates have promised to vote for the winner of their congressional district or the statewide primary, which appears to be 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump. In the latest Monmouth poll, Trump held a 13-point lead over Cruz and a 15-point lead over Kasich.Will Trump Win?Even though Trump leads in Pennsylvania polls, that advantage may not translate into more delegates.The first thing to consider is the presidential primary preference vote. The winner of this contest gets all of Pennsylvaniaâs 17 at-large and bonus delegates. Voters select the other 54 delegate candidates, who are not listed with any candidate allegiances.Some of the delegates have publicly announced who they will support so voters know which candidate they are backing in the primary. This process causes campaigns to lobby different delegates in order to secure a public promise of their votes at the RNC.Because unpledged delegates do not have their support listed on the ballot, as is the case in other states, Republican voters could unknowingly vote for a delegate who supports a presidential candidate they do not support.Unpledged delegates are also not bound to vote for the presidential candidate they have endorsed. For example, the delegate candidate could say they will vote for Trump or the statewide winner and then vote for Ohio Gov. John Kasich at the convention if they wanted.Political pundits have said that Trump cannot rely on Pennsylvania delegate votes at the convention because there will be a lot of pressure on the delegates to not vote for him.At the Cleveland convention, most delegates are required to vote for a specific candidate on the first ballot, unlike most of the delegates in Pennsylvania. Trump would be favored to win a majority of Pennsylvaniaâs 71 delegates under any other primary system.This âloophole primary,â as some media outlets have called it, results in Pennsylvaniaâs delegation playing a major role at the convention. The Pennsylvania GOP primary thus presents an opportunity for Cruz and Kasich to acquire delegates from Trump and impede his path to the nomination.\n",

            "Voter turnout on campus increased five-fold from 2015, the year of the last mayoral election, according to Penn Leads the Vote data released Wednesday. On Tuesday, at least 1,058 students voted for mayor and city council positions. In November 2015, only 213 students voted on election day. Philadelphians re-elected incumbent Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney and upended City Council's two-party dynamic by voting in a progressive third-party candidate, marking the first time since 1980 that a third-party candidate or independent won a city-wide election.    In Philadelphia's City Council system, five at-large seats are essentially reserved for the majority party â currently the Democratic Party â as each party can put up a maximum of five candidates.  This leaves two at-large seats left over for candidates in the minority party, seats which have traditionally been occupied by Republicans. This year, the Working Families Party, a progressive independent party, succeeded in winning one seat, while Republicans also won one seat. Benjamin Oh, Penn Leads the Vote co-director and graduate student in social policy, said progressive policies, like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, likely played a role in increasing voter turnout. \"These really visionary policies that have been proposed on the national level help students conceptualize how the issues politicians, national and local, deal with on a daily basis really influence their lives,\" Oh said. \"A lot of students have said, 'I want to vote because I believe in this policy and I want to show support for it.'\" While turnout in local elections has sharply risen in recent years, it pales in comparison to voter turnout in last year's midterm election. Data from Penn Leads the Vote shows that 8,426 students voted in the 2018 midterms. âInterest in engagement doesnât really translate into local politics,â Oh said. âThere was one year where there were some of the precincts that had zero voters, or just one voter who showed up to vote for the entire day.â Penn Democrats President and College junior EJ Carlson said Penn Dems encouraged voter turnout via a Facebook page, personal texts, and the groupâs voter guide. âNot only do we post all over our social media that it is Election Day, but we also provide a lot of resources to our members and the Penn community,â she said. âIf they see that people are passionate about who is running, there is more incentive to go out and vote.â \"Voter turnout was substantially larger this year, but unfortunately these voters did not fight for improved city governance,\" College Republicans Communications Director and Wharton sophomore Corey Paredes wrote in an email to The Daily Pennsylvanian. WFP candidate Kendra Brooks won one at-large City Council seat on Tuesday, with fellow party candidate Nicolas O'Rourke narrowly losing out on the second minority party at-large seat to a Republican incumbent.  Oh said increased civic participation by students played a role in bolstering the campaign of Brooks. \"Our ward actually gave Kendra Brooks the second-highest number of votes out of any of the wards within Philadelphia,\" Oh said. \"That is a signal students, almost more than any other demographic group, really care about the issues that are at hand now.\" Carlson said Penn Dems didn't endorse the WFP candidate but the group hosted Brooks and O'Rourke at a club event. And even without an endorsement, the Penn Dems voting guide featured the two candidates, in an effort to inform members of their candidacies. She said the WFP's strength was a sign of establishment politics losing power in the city. \"The fact that the Working Families Party was able to get so many votes, and pull votes away from Democrats, in order to get their own seats, that's notable,\" Carlson said. \"It's definitely a signal that the Democratic machine in Philadelphia is getting a little bit weaker, for better or for worse.\" Randall Miller, a Saint Joseph's University history professor who specializes in Philadelphia politics, said the city clearly experienced a notable leftward shift during this election cycle. As a result, Miller said establishment Democrats are under pressure to shift their ideology towards the extremes. \"The Democrats can't simply assume because we control everything, we can do anything we want,\" Miller said. \"There has been a real progressive push the last several years.\" Miller also said while it was unusual for third-party candidates to do so well, Brooks and O'Rourke were able to capitalize on strong campaigns to have a strong finish. \"There was external money to help these candidates,\" Miller said, referencing the hundreds of thousands of dollars Brooks raised â the most of any Philadelphia third-party candidate in history. \"The candidates were well organized.\"\n",

            "This election has seen many firsts, such as the nomination of a woman to lead a major party presidential ticket, the Harvard Republican Clubâs refusal to endorse their partyâs nominee and the refusal of a presidential candidate to release tax returns. Yet it still seems that the greatest first may be the unlikely success of independent candidate 2011 Wharton graduate Evan McMullin. McMullin has led recent polls in his home state of Utah, including one released by Emerson College on Oct. 19. If he were to win the state, it would be the first time Utah has elected a non-Republican presidential candidate since 1964, when its four electoral votes went in support of President Lyndon B. Johnson.Now, Utah has the opportunity to be pivotal in an election in which no one had pegged it for a swing state. If McMullin snags Utah, he willbecome the first independent to win electoral votes in a general election since 1968, when Alabama Gov. George Wallace took Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana.Unlike the other two prominent candidates, McMullinâs historyis not public knowledge. The 40-year-old independent candidate is a Mormon from Provo, Utah. He attended Brigham Young University and earned a Masterâs degree in Business Administration from Wharton in 2011.According to his website, McMullin worked in the CIA for about a decade and spent some time in investment banking. He later joined the House Committee on Foreign Affairs as a senior advisor and eventually became the Chief Policy Director of the House Republican Conference.âIn a year where Americans have lost faith in the candidates of both major parties, itâs time for a generation of new leadership to step up,â McMullin said to ABC News after announcing his bid for the presidency.In the Utah primary caucuses in March, Donald Trump garnered only 14 percent of the vote and landed in third place.While it is nearly impossible for a third-party candidate to win the election directly, it is not entirely impossible for them to change the course of the election and deadlock the Electoral College. Though Utahâs current six electoral votes may not seem like enough to tie up the 538 electors, experts say it may be possible.A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to claim victory. Taking six electoral votes out of the race could leave either candidate hanging without a majority, in which case the election would be sent to Congress under the Twelfth Amendment.For Trump, this would only serve to narrow his already extremely tight path to the presidency. Though McMullin qualified to have his name on the ballot in only 11 states, winning even one of these states could upset the traditional electoral math.Unlike former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate who is drawing relatively equal levels of support away from Clinton and Trump, McMullin is largely drawing his support from Republicans who cannot stomach a Trump presidency.Trump has not been popular with Mormons, and a strong disavowal from 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who won Utah by about 50 points, has not helped him either.In June 2016, two months before McMullin entered the race, The New York Times ran an op-ed entitled âDonald Trumpâs Mormon Problem.â The article detailed how Trumpâs qualities and values clash with Mormonsâ, who place a high value on chastity and hold âmerciful viewsâ on immigration.The Emerson College poll showed McMullin is polling strongest among younger voters. He has  36 percent of voters under 35 years old compared to Trump and Clintonâs equal 22 percent.The Emerson study also showed a decline in Republican support for Trump in Utah. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) won the Utah caucus with an impressive 69 percent of the vote. Of those Cruz supporters, 51 percent are backing McMullin and only 29 percent plan to vote for Trump.The same discontent that fueled Trumpâs rise may now be creating blowback for him in a state that was never thought to be up in the air for Republicans.\n",

            "Penn Democrats president and rising College senior Owen Voutsinas-Klose will serve as a delegate for former Vice President Joe Biden at the upcoming 2020 Democratic National Convention. Voutsinas-Klose, who also serves as co-chair of Penn for Biden, was officially declared a delegate on June 16 after running in Pennsylvaniaâs primary election on June 2.  As a delegate, Voutsinas-Klose will cast his vote for Biden to become the Democratic partyâs presidential nominee at the DNC. Although delegates typically attend the Democratic convention, Voutsinas-Klose will cast his vote virtually or by mail due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. The DNC is still scheduled to take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in mid-August, but due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, state delegates have been asked to stay home this year. The convention will also be modified to include âlive broadcasts and curated content,â according to a press release by organizers.  Though Biden formally clinched the Democratic presidential nomination on June 5 after receiving the 1,991 delegates needed to earn the nomination, he is expected to travel to Milwaukee and accept the Democratic nomination in person. Voutsinas-Klose said he acknowledges that Biden has struggled to gain the youth voting bloc, and that Biden has been criticized for his political record, including his support of the controversial 1994 Crime Bill. Still, Voutsinas-Klose said he wanted to be a delegate for Biden, largely because he believes the former Penn Presidential Professor of Practice is the best candidate to defeat President and 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump due to his broad appeal to voters from various backgrounds. â[Biden] is very open to different peopleâs positions, to changing his mind when heâs wrong, [and] making America a better place for everybody by including people of all political ideologies â including people who are much more liberal than him â in his cabinet,â Voutsinas-Klose said. According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted from May 25 through May 28, Biden holds a 10-point lead over Trump for the general election, with 53% of registered voters polled supporting Biden and 43% supporting Trump. Jack Cahill, a rising College junior and co-director of Penn Justice Democrats, formerly Penn for Bernie, was also on the ballot as a delegate for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but did not receive enough votes to be elected as a delegate for the Convention.  Due to party rules, candidates who drop-out of the presidential race â like Sanders did on April 8 â are supposed to reallocate their delegates to the active candidates. The Biden campaign, however, has agreed to fill the delegate positions â that Sanders typically would be expected to give up â with Sanders' supporters, in an effort to avoid bitter feelings between the Democratic establishment and Sanders' supporters. For Voutsinas-Klose, becoming a delegate is rewarding because of the people he was able to interact with during his campaign. In order to collect enough signatures to get his name on the ballot, Voutsinas-Klose petitioned across Philadelphia, where he met with local party activists and residents. âI was able to get off campus and meet actual Philadelphians and talk to them about where they see the political process, whatâs important to them, and see different issues through different lenses across the city,â he said. âI think that was definitely the most meaningful political experience Iâve had at Penn.â Voutsinas-Klose emphasized the importance of youth participation in the upcoming election, especially among Penn students. Pennsylvania is currently an influential swing state that has the potential to determine the outcome of the presidential election. âIn my opinion, itâs the most consequential election of our lifetime,â Voutsinas-Klose said. âAmerica is going to be unrecognizable if Donald Trump gets four more years, is able to appoint new Supreme Court judges, and write new laws, and weâre in the perfect spot to make a difference.â\n",

            "In politics, endorsements can make or break a candidateâs chances at winning an election. Now, Penn Democrats are considering endorsing a wide variety of candidates for political office, including a candidate for the looming presidential primaries. But despite a slew of Democrats declaring their candidacies for the 2020 presidential election in recent weeks, Penn Dems plan to wait to endorse a favored candidate until March 2020. The club wants to hear firsthand from visiting candidates and conduct extensive research into the potential Democratic nominees for president. With less than 11 months until the Iowa caucuses, the primaries are starting to get crowded â 14 Democrats are currently vying for the nomination. Prominent figures such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) have declared, as well as lesser-known candidates such as South Bend, Ind. mayor Pete Buttigieg and author Marianne Williamson. Former Vice President and Penn Presidential Professor of Practice Joe Biden has still yet to announce whether he will run. The groupâs process for endorsing candidates can vary and there is no explicit endorsement policy. But board members said it generally involves the organization gathering as much information as possible before the executive board makes a final decision.  âAs a club, we try to meet as many candidates as possible, whether we host them at our deputy board meetings or we have them at speaker events,â President of Penn Dems and College sophomore Emma Carlson said. Penn Dems will also endorse some candidates in the upcoming Philadelphia primary elections. Penn Dems Communications Director and College freshman Tamara Wurman, who is also a DP photographer, said the Penn Dems executive board voted in late February to endorse Penn graduate Jamie Gauthier for a City Council seat. Gauthier graduated in 2004 with a master's in city and regional planning. The endorsement process may differ for national elections, such as the 2020 presidential primaries.   âFor more high profile elections, such as the presidential primary or national Senate races, you can expect a more detailed explanation,â Wurman said. The group has endorsed candidates in contentious presidential primaries in the past, such as Barack Obama in 2008âs race against Hillary Clinton. More recently, Penn Dems endorsed Clinton over Bernie Sanders back in February 2016, well before she secured the partyâs nomination in July.  Despite the groupâs early endorsement in 2016, Penn Dems Political Director Owen Voutsinas-Klose said not to expect a presidential endorsement anytime soon.   âWeâre not going to endorse for President obviously this year,â Voutsinas-Klose said, as Pennsylvania's primary occurs on April 28, 2020. âThat might be something that happens next year.â Carlson said Penn Dems will likely make a decision âprobably after Super Tuesday at least,â referring to the early March 2020 date when numerous states hold their primaries. Although the groupâs endorsement for president may come relatively late in 2020, efforts are already underway to bring presidential candidates to campus.  Carlson noted that one presidential challenger, former U.S. Rep. John Delaney (D-MD), is scheduled to speak to Penn Dems in April. Candidate visits to Penn may have possible political implications, Voutsinas-Klose said. As a political group at an Ivy League School located in a swing state, he said visits to Penn Dems should draw the attention of national candidates. Those who take the time to visit campus will likely be seen more favorably by the clubâs base, he added.  âThatâs who our members are going to respect,â Voutsinas-Klose said. \n",

            "Republicans in Harrisburg are rocking the boat â not only with Democrats, but also with their Republican counterparts in Washington. Dominic Pileggi, Pennsylvania senate majority leader, announced a proposal to restructure how the state votes in the presidential election. If the proposal is adopted, Pennsylvania electoral votes will be given to candidates based on congressional districts rather than a âwinner take allâ approach under which the state currently functions. The new system would give two electoral votes to the winner of the overall vote automatically, but the rest of the electoral votes would be based on the popular vote of each district, meaning that there almost certainly would be a split vote in the Commonwealth and both candidates would receive Pennsylvania electoral votes. The Republicans in Harrisburg are also in charge of redistricting the state this year from the information gathered in the 2010 census, giving the party control over the Congressional District boundaries that would be determining the allocation of electoral votes in the new system. The issue of the electoral voting system is a national issue, and Pennsylvania is not the only state to be considering it. In fact, two other states, Maine and Nebraska, have already adopted this system, though both are much smaller states than Pennsylvania in terms of electoral votes. Pennsylvania, which is a major swing state given its 21 electoral votes, is a significant focus of most presidential election campaigns. Although almost always a close election, Pennsylvania electoral votes have not gone to a Republican candidate since 1988. This legislation could change that trend dramatically. âThe goal is to have the votes in the electoral college more closely reflect the popular vote,â Pileggi said. âThis is one way to do that.â Pennsylvaniaâs Republican Gov. Tom Corbett has endorsed the bill.  Although the bill is supported by the GOP in Harrisburg, many Washington Republicans are worried about the bill backfiring. If their candidate is polling well in Pennsylvania, the new system would do to the GOP what it is accused of trying to do to Democrats: split the vote so the candidate gets fewer electoral votes than the complete 21. Also, if the bill passes in Pennsylvania, other traditionally important states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio may propose similar bills â which the GOP does not want, given that it recently took control of those states. On the other side, most Democrats are furious over the bill, but have very little power to influence the choice given their comparative numbers. Former Democratic Gov. and Penn professor Ed Rendell said the bill will be detrimental to Pennsylvaniaâs importance in the national election, a fact that in the past has given Pennsylvania some leverage on the national stage. Washington has historically been âmuch less eager to tick us off because it carries consequences come the presidential election â¦ It takes away all of our clout,â Rendell said. âA lot of attention from presidential candidates and a lot of money is spent in Pennsylvania,â he added. â[This bill] is not democratic, with a small âdâ. It goes against the spirit of one person, one vote and it disenfranchises those districts that have a lot of Democrats or a lot of Republicans,â Rendell said. âVoters know that they are contributing to a state wide total that will determine a candidate â¦ now there is no motivation to get off your butt and vote [if you live in a district that is a high majority Democrat or Republican],â he added. He went on to say that the bill is âsomewhere between reprehensible and despicable.â State Sen. Daylin Leach, who has led the charge opposing the bill in Harrisburg, wrote in a Philly.com article: âWe should be suspicious any time one political party unilaterally tries to directly affect the outcome of future elections. Republicans in Harrisburg want to award electoral votes according to congressional districts because they are in control of the current redistricting process. They want to be able to decide how many votes to guarantee future Republican presidential candidates.â\n",

            "On March 21, 2018, Conor Lamb received an official concession from his Republican challenger in Pennsylvaniaâs high-profile special election for the stateâs 18th Congressional District. The area voted for Donald Trump by more than 20 percentage points in 2016, but Lamb squeaked out a victory by 627 votes. Exactly one year after his upset victory, the 2006 College and 2009 Penn Law graduate returned to his alma mater to pitch his pragmatic vision for the Democratic party amid its recent leftward shift. At a Thursday discussion hosted by Penn Democrats, the recently re-elected Congressman indicated his support for former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, expressed his skepticism of the Green New Deal, and revealed his view on how to appeal to working class voters. Lamb said while Biden is his initial favorite to win his endorsement in the Democratic presidential primary, any Democrat seeking Lamb's support needs to have priorities similar to his constituents. âThere are some who just clearly get it in terms of union rights, jobs, concerns of elderly people,â Lamb said. âIâll be listening.â The congressman also took a skeptical view of progressive ideas gaining popularity among some in the Democratic party. While he said he was âfineâ with the concept of the Green New Deal, he noted how its sponsors â Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) â were representing liberal constituencies, and that people in his district have been skeptical. âWhere I come from, people are a little more practical and pragmatic. They want to know how things like this are going to affect our jobs and how is this going to affect our energy bills,â Lamb said. âIt doesnât really address any of those things.â  Lamb added that while he might agree with some of the policy proposals of his more progressive candidates, he encouraged them to change their messaging and wording when announcing their policies. âYou might have a lot of things in there that are good for the average working person in Pittsburgh, but maybe itâs lost in translation,â Lamb said. Lamb identified the economic problems facing his district, the Rust Belt at large, and other regions throughout the country. He noted that problems affecting western Pennsylvania, such as outsourcing and a declining steel industry, have been systemic struggles for the region. âThese things were all happening long before President Trump ever came along,â Lamb said. âWeâre dealing with 50-year problems.â Lamb emerged as one of the Democratic stars of Trump's first year in office, as his election in a strongly Republican district marked the second high-profile victory of the period for Democrats in what is traditionally GOP territory. Doug Jones (D-Ga.) defeated Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate election in December 2017, surprising the conservative state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. After Pennsylvania changed its congressional districts in 2018, Lamb ran again in November 2018 and won in the newly formed 17th Congressional District. To win back the White House in 2020, Lamb said Democrats âcanât let what happened in 2016 happen again,â emphasizing the need to regain support in western Pennsylvania. Penn Presidential Professor of Practice and Scranton, Pa.-born Biden, Lamb said, \"starts out as an obvious leader in that group [of 2020 candidates] for me based on his connections to Pennsylvania.â\n",

            "In a tight race for one of Pennsylvaniaâs Senate seats, Republican candidate Pat Toomey defeated Democratic candidate Joe Sestak by 51 to 49 percent of the statewide vote, with 99 percent of districts reporting. GOP candidate Tom Corbett won the governorâs race over Democrat Dan Onorato by a 9-percent margin. As many pundits expected, the Senate will remain in Democratic hands, 50 seats to 46 seats, with four seats still undecided as of 1:45 a.m. Wednesday. However, the House of Representatives shifted to a Republican majority, as the party now controls 230 seats  â  12 more than needed for a majority, with 40 seats still undecided â as of press time. Despite Toomeyâs and Corbettâs wins, both Sestak and Onorato enjoyed an overwhelming majority vote on and around Pennâs campus. At the 10 polling locations closest to campus, Sestak received 84.6 percent of the vote and Onorato 83.7 percent, revealing strong Democratic support at Penn. Penn Democrats President and College junior Emma Ellman-Golan was âdisappointedâ but not surprised by the electionâs results. However, the high Philadelphia and Penn voter participation âexceededâ her expectations. âWe didnât need to persuade voters. We just needed to get them to the polls, and I think we did a great job,â she said. According to College Republicans President and Engineering junior Peter Terpeluk, the Republican senatorial and gubernatorial races were âclearly a reaction toward the politics of the past year.â âElections mean something,â he added. âYou canât ignore that fact anymore.â In the May Democratic Senate primary, Sestak defeated incumbent Sen. Arlen Specter in a close race, receiving 53.9 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, Toomey cruised to victory for the Republican nomination, beating Peg Luksik 81.4 to 18.6 percent. In an Oct. 12 Rasmussen poll, Toomey received 49 percent of the vote compared to Sestakâs 39 percent. However, the gap between the candidates closed toward the end of the race â a shift which some pundits attribute to a late spending surge by the Democratâs campaign. According to an Oct. 28 Rasmussen poll, voters favored Toomey 50 percent to Sestakâs 46 percent. Although leading by a smaller margin than earlier in the race, Toomey has been favored by the polls since the raceâs outset. Toomey, a former congressman from Pennsylvaniaâs 15th District, ran on a platform of small business and payroll tax cuts as well as decreased business regulation. He opposes same-sex marriage, but supports the repeal of the âDonât Ask, Donât Tellâ military policy as long as it does not negatively impact the militaryâs capabilities. In the gubernatorial race, Onorato won a four-way Democratic primary but had trailed Corbett consistently since the outset of the general election season. Onorato made a minor dent in Corbettâs lead at the same time as Sestakâs October surge, but the Democrat never led in any poll, according to data compiled by RealClearPolitics.com, which tracks survey data.\n",

            "Election Day is finally here, and the Democratic Party made one of its biggest final stands right on Pennâs campus. At one of the last Democratic rallies this election season, First Lady Michelle Obama spoke to a crowd of 3,500 Penn students and community members in the frigid November weather about the stakes of Tuesdayâs midterm election. âThis election is about all we have left to do,â Obama said. âSo let me ask you â can we do this?â Some classes were forced to relocate as a result of the rally. Houston, College and Claudia Cohen halls were all closed to students for security purposes Monday afternoon, according to an e-mail from Office of Student Affairs Executive Director Karu Kozuma. A litany of Pennsylvania Democrats joined the First Lady in front of Houston Hall, including Democratic senatorial nominee Joe Sestak and gubernatorial nominee Dan Onorato. Sen. Robert Casey, Sen. Arlen Specter, U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah, Mayor Michael Nutter and Gov. Ed Rendell were also present. Specter, Fattah, Nutter and Rendell are all Penn alumni. The First Ladyâs trip comes just two days after President Barack Obamaâs visit to Temple University on Saturday, highlighting the importance Democrats are placing on Pennsylvania this election season. â[They] donât think youâre showing up to vote,â Onorato said to the Penn student-dominated crowd, explaining that experts expect a drop-off in turnout from those 25 and under. College Democrats of America Communications Director Michael Worley attributed this focus to the number of student and union voters in the state. âTurning out these key constituencies will play an important role in getting Democrats like Joe Sestak and Dan Onorato elected,â Worley wrote in an e-mail. For some Democratic leaders on campus, the specific focus on Philadelphia is directly related to the traditional role the city plays in offsetting Republican turnout in other parts of the state. âIn the last 20 years, every time a Democrat in a statewide race has won Philadelphia by 350,000 votes, the Democrat has won,â Penn Democrats Deputy Political Director and Wharton sophomore Troy Daly said. With the focus of the election now strictly on turnout â an area in which polls suggest Republicans have a significant advantage â the rallies are designed to raise enthusiasm among Democratic supporters. A Gallup poll conducted from Sept. 20 to 26 indicated that 20 percent more Republicans than Democrats were âvery enthusiastic about voting.â â[Republican] enthusiasm is already there,â said College Republicans Treasurer and Wharton junior Charles Gray. However, he also admitted that the Obama rallies do âmake a difference.â âIt really does build an enthusiasm that Republicans will have to counter,â Gray, a former Daily Pennsylvanian columnist, added. Some Democrats at the rally discounted the importance of these polls. âThereâs only one poll that counts,â Nutter said. âItâs the poll that opens at 7 a.m. tomorrow.â Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday. Penn Leads the Vote will staff a table on Locust Walk throughout the day, providing information on polling locations across campus.\n",

            "Fraternity Alpha Sigma Phi is recolonizing this spring after a lengthy hiatus from Pennâs Greek community. The national Alpha Sigma Phi organization is set to begin gauging interest within the Penn community at the end of this semester and is planning to officially begin colonizing after formal spring rush in 2013. âThey are returning after a long time off campus and have already begun to mobilize Penn alumni to work with the chapter,â Director of the Office of Student Affairs/Fraternity Sorority Life Scott Reikofski said. The Omicron chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi was originally founded at Penn in 1914 and closed in 1978, according to Reikofski. Both Reikofski and the fraternityâs national office were unsure why the chapter left campus. Alpha Sigma Phi Vice President Matt Humberger cited a long history between the fraternity and Penn as a main reason for recolonization. Pennâs Omicron chapter was one of the first Alpha Sigma Phi chapters to colonize in the country, and includes notable alumni such as former Wharton student Warren Buffett. âIt is always good to see the Greek community expanding,â Interfraternity Council President and College senior David Shapiro said. âThe fact that Alpha Sigma Phi wants to recolonize at Penn speaks to the vibrancy and health of our Greek system.â Alpha Sigma Phi is following a five-step process in colonizing as an officially recognized fraternity on campus. Step one is called prospecting. Starting in mid-December, Alpha Sigma Phi national will begin reaching out to students through Facebook and other social media, looking to attract both freshmen and upperclassmen according to Humberger. For male students, this is the first opportunity to join a new fraternity since Alpha Delta Phi Society, a small co-ed chapter, joined Pennâs Greek community in fall 2010. Before that, fraternity Phi Delta Gamma recolonized in fall 2008. âOur plan is to make the community stronger and to create a new experience to students on campus,â Humberger said. âBringing fresh organizations to campus is good for the community as a whole.â Step two is recruiting. Alpha Sigma Phi staff will arrive on campus and will pin down a concrete interest group. They are hoping to find between 35 to 65 interested students by mid-to-late February. âWeâre looking for students in the top five percent,â Humberger said. âWeâre looking for students who want to make a difference and leave a legacy on campus.â Humberger is confident that Alpha Sigma Phi will be able to find dedicated students who will quickly assume leadership positions in the Greek community. âAlpha Sigma Phi is nationally known for its strong emphasis on fostering leadership amongst its members,â Shapiro said. âThe leadership element, along with the additional programming and diversity Alpha Sigma Phi will bring to the existing community, will add significantly to both IFC and the greater Greek community.â In step three, colonization, the interest group becomes a colony and gets one step closer to being a chartered chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi. Five weeks after colonization, the students will become fully initiated members of Alpha Sigma Phi. This is planned to take place near the end of the spring 2013 semester. The final step in the process is chartering. Pennâs chapter will become an official chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi, which normally takes between six to 12 months after initiation. Reikofski believes Alpha Sigma Phi âwill provide another option for those who are seeking a values-based fraternity experience.â âA good fraternity or sorority chapter that is living by their values and doing what they are designed to be doing provides a superlative support for students and their academic pursuits,â he said. âI am confident Alpha Sigma Phi will be excellent partners.â\n",

            "This school year, Greek life made headlines for a plethora of reasons. Whether you are considering joining Greek life at Penn or not, it can be useful to know what has happened and how it works. Here is a guide to the recent Greek life happenings.Greek News to Know:On March 1, the annual Northeast Greek Leadership Association recognized Pennâs Multicultural Greek Council during this yearâs conference in Pittsburgh, Pa. MGC won the Amy Vojta Impact Award for outstanding Multicultural Greek Programming.After 20 years, Director of the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life Scott Reikofski retired. He oversaw the upgrade of over 24 University-managed chapter houses. Earlier that year, Meghan Gaffney took over as Associate Director at OFSL.Penn Greek life also made some controversial headlines. After Phi Delta Theta posted a controversial Christmas photo on Facebook that involved a dark-skinned blow up doll, minority groups on campus expressed their discontent. Phi Delt was put under investigation and placed on probation. They were also required to complete cultural sensitivity and sexual and relationship misconduct education programs. One group, Students Organizing for Unity and Liberation, protested the fraternity by holding a mock slave auction in front of the fraternityâs house this April.Alpha Chi Omega made its own spalsh. After being placed on probation in January following a phone call made by a Penn studentâs parent to the University after a drinking event, Pennâs chapter of Alpha Chi Omega decided to go off-campus, instead of abstaining from social events for the next two years.By the Numbers:Today at Penn there are 53 Greek social fraternity and sorority chapters, 30 chapters in the Interfraternity Council, nine chapters in the Panhellenic Council and 14 chapters in the Multicultural Greek Council.The Rush Process:Pennâs main recruitment processes take place in the spring semester as soon as everyone arrives back from winter break at the end of January. This differs slightly from schools with a larger Greek life scene. Currently, the overall number of students actively involved in our Greek system is more than 25 percent of the total undergraduate student population at Penn.Having recruitment in the spring allows students time to get settled into the college experience, as well as to weigh the Greek life options. Recruitment, also known as rush, can be an exciting, hectic time.Fraternity v. Sorority Rush:Recruitment differs greatly for guys and girls on campus. Boys attend date nights and hangouts where they get to know the brothers of the fraternities that they are interested in.Rushing a sorority, on the other hand, is a different story. Girls visit the nine sorority houses with different rounds on different days, meeting many girls in a complicated but organized selection process. They are guided along houses by a recruitment guide called a Rho Gamma.Life as a Greek:Once joining Greek life, weekends are filled with date nights, formals and bonding activities. Philanthropy events also raise money for causes like Alzheimerâs or breast cancer research.\n",

            " This Hey Day, the Class of 2009 will greet the current juniors not with condiments but with a raised glass. The Senior- and Junior-Class Boards have established what they hope will become a new tradition with the \"Final Toast,\" an event that aims to welcome the outgoing seniors into the alumni community while celebrating the incoming seniors at the same time. The event, held on April 24 from 1-4 p.m. in conjunction with Hey Day, will include live music, guests, food and drinks on the Class of 1972 Terrace behind the Sweeten Alumni House and the northwestern section of College Green. Those seniors who sign a pledge committing to safe behavior will be permitted to attend. The Class of 2009 will then salute the junior class from the Terrace and College Green as they march down Locust Walk. \"This is the initial step in welcoming the class of 2009 into the alumni community,\" Senior Class President Brett Perlmutter said. \"It's a great opportunity to create a new tradition.\" The event will be catered and will also serve free alcohol for those seniors with wristbands. Perlmutter acknowledged the support the Senior- and Junior-Class Boards have received from outside sources in making both Final Toast and this year's Hey Day possible, including Alumni Relations and Penn Traditions, the Office of the Vice Provost for University Life, the Office of Student Life, the Council of Undergraduate Deans, Penn Police, the Office of Health Education, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs, the Undergraduate Assembly and Penn President Amy Gutmann. \"The event is more upscale,\" Perlmutter described. \"It's a sign of the trust that the University has put in the senior class.\"  Related StoriesHey Day moved back to a Friday for 2009 | Interactive feature - NewsFrom canes to condiments - NewsSafer Hey Day secures tradition - NewsOfficials: Hey Day could be changed or canceled  - News\n",

            "Phi Kappa Sigma fraternityâs charter has been suspended by its national headquarters, according to Executive Director of Phi Kappa Sigma Toby Smith. The decision was made pending an investigation of the death of John Carroll University student Matthew Crozier, Smith wrote in an e-mail. Crozier suffered fatal head injuries after a fall at the fraternityâs chapter house on New Yearâs Eve. For the time being, â[Skulls] canât hold any activities as a fraternity,â Skulls president and Wharton junior Max Holz said. âI think that decision is probably one that has been made with a lot of thought and consideration,â Interfraternity Council president and Wharton junior Harris Heyer said. âIf a suspension is going to help the national organization sort out the various issues that the local chapter may be facing, that solution is obviously preferable,â he added. Skulls has been on administrative warning from the Office of Student Affairs/Fraternity and Sorority Life since the beginning of January, Holz said. The fraternity was also barred from recruiting new members this semester. Penn Police confirmed the presence of alcohol at the chapter house on the night of Crozierâs death, despite Skullsâ strict policy as a âdryâ fraternity, as stated on their website. Neither the national organization nor Holz were able to give further comment as to the future of Pennâs chapter, which was created in 1850 as the founding chapter of Phi Kappa Sigma. Office of Student Affairs/Fraternity Sorority Life Director Scott Reikofski was unavailable for comment throughout the weekend and on Monday.\n",

            "This weekend, Phi Gamma Delta, also known as Fiji, received a charter to be reinstated as an official Penn fraternity. Brothers will move into their house on 3619 Locust Walk this September. âItâs very rewarding to be back,â said Fiji President and College junior Kit Neuman. Phi Gamma Delta members surrendered the chapter in 1999, following the death of an alumnus who fell several stories at the fraternity house, where he had been drinking heavily. While Neuman recognizes the incident was âupsetting and tragic,â he believes Fiji is ready to move on. âFiji now is not the Fiji of 10 years ago,â he said.  The fraternity began colonizing on Pennâs campus in fall 2008 and currently has 59 members. Over the weekend, colony members were joined by Fijiâs executive director and alumni in a series of events to initiate members and celebrate the fraternityâs return to campus.  âThey have worked tirelessly to get us back on campus,â said College junior and Fiji Historian Vaughn Stewart. Stewart, a former Daily Pennsylvanian opinion blogger, added that the chapter house will be a âhuge selling point for recruiting new members.â A graduate advisor will be living in the Fiji house next year, according to Neuman. This policy was a stipulation of the fraternityâs return to campus. Neuman said the fraternity hopes to find a Fiji alumnus to serve as its GA, since it is important to have âsomeone who understands fraternity life and can also be an authority figure if needed.â âItâs the lesser of two evils,â Wharton junior and Interfraternity Council President Christian Lunoe said of having a Fiji GA. He added that the IFC is against any general GA policy in fraternities.\n",

            "The Social Planning and Events Committee will revert Spring Fling to its two-day format in hopes of increasing concert attendance.  SPEC changed Fling from a two-day to a one-day event in 2018, when they moved the event to Penn Park from the Quad. This year, the headliner concert will take place on Friday, April 17, while the Fling festival, which features food, games, and student group performances, will take place during the day on Saturday, April 18, SPEC President and Wharton senior Linda Ashmead said. Ashmead added that Fling will continue to take place in Penn Park. The Fling concert saw low concert attendance in the first year Fling was consolidated into a one-day event. Ashmead said that SPEC hopes to increase turnout at the concert by returning to Fling's two day format. She added that SPEC wanted to bring back a new kind of hype around the concert by kicking off the weekend with the concert. College junior Shana Vaid said she is pleased with the change and thinks more people will attend the concert on Friday night. Vaid added that she believes people have left the festival before the concert in the past two years, because they made other plans for the evening or were too tired by the end of the festival. \"Trying to fit it into one day just condenses it too much and makes it less fun,\" Vaid said. \"I think it'll definitely lead more people to go, especially if they are better at vetting who they choose to have at the concert.\" College junior Declan Stecher said that he is also optimistic about Fling changing back to being a two-day event. Wharton senior Tyler Knox said, however, he thinks fewer people will attend the festival at Penn Park if it is on a different day than the concert. He said he thinks people will be less likely to walk all the way to Penn Park if the concert is not on the same day as the festival. Knox said he will still attend the festival to see his friends performances. I think the average student who maybe doesn't have that kind of motivation may find it harder to decide to go to that portion of Fling, Knox said. When SPEC made the festival into a one-day event in 2018, the number of student group performers was cut in half due to the shortened time frame. Ashmead said that because the concert is no longer immediately after the festival, SPEC will talk to Penn Athletics about extending the length of the festival to host more student groups. Wharton senior Lina Shi, a member of the Pan-Asian Dance Troupe, said she supports the change to a two days. She added that after her group performed during the Fling festival before 2018, they held a gathering on Saturday night to celebrate their performance. When SPEC consolidated Fling to a one-day event and moved the concert to the same night as the festival, however, Shi said they could no longer host the gathering. Its kind of nice theyre changing the main concert to Friday night, so everyone can hang out on Friday [at the concert], and then student groups can do stuff on Saturday night, Shi said. Last year, students criticized SPEC's decision to invite Miguel to perform at Fling, citing a 2017 sexual assault allegation. More than 250 people marked \"going\" or \"interested\" on a Facebook event called \"Stand Against Miguel at Fling\" to protest the singers atrocities\" through a boycott. The organizers called on students to stand against Miguel by not purchasing a ticket or by leaving before Miguels performance.\n",

            "The Alpha Beta chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha accepted its first pledge class of 150 girls in February since being re-established on Pennâs campus. In 1991, a similar process was taking place this time of year but for Pi Beta Phi, a sorority that no longer exists at Penn. Pi Beta Phi, along with Sigma Kappa, were the last two sororities waiting to be added to Pennâs Panhellenic system in a larger expansion plan that included the colonization of five new sororities.  Sigma Kappa did not come to Penn until 2002. The other three â Alpha Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta and Alpha Chi Omega â had already been established. Of the five sororities added, Pi Beta Phi is the only sorority not still established at Penn.  Nine years later, The Daily Pennsylvanian reported that the sorority was giving up its house and had decided not to accept a pledge class in 2000. The national organization did not revoke Pi Phiâs charter, but it disbanded because of low membership in 2000.  Pi Beta Phi was the last sorority to leave Pennâs campus until the Phi Sigma Sigma chapter was revoked by its national headquarters, also for low membership numbers â paving the way for ZTA to become Pennâs newest eighth sorority.

Then, three hours before the show, SPEC-TRUM cancelled the concert altogether after Metro Boomin missed his flight to Philadelphia, according to the Facebook event.Originally, SPEC-TRUM planned its annual spring concert featuring YG, Metro Boomin and Kamaiyah to be held on Wednesday night at 8 p.m. at the 23rd Street Armory. The event was scheduled for the last day of classes to celebrate the end of the year, and SPEC-TRUM had been selling tickets on Locust Walk and online leading up to the event.At 9 a.m. on Wednesday, SPEC-TRUM posted on its Facebook event page that âbecause YG is ill, he is no longer able to make it to our SPEC-TRUM Spring Show at 8 p.m.âThe 26-year-old Compton, California-born rapper was supposed to be the headliner for the show, and after the announcement, the concert â then featuring only Metro Boomin and Kamiayah â became free for all PennCard holders and $10 for the public.Anyone who had already bought a physical ticket or bought one online for $20 would be reimbursed, SPEC-TRUM posted.Then at 5 p.m., SPEC-TRUM posted another update, this time completely cancelling the event after Metro Boomin missed his flight. SPEC-TRUM stated that âWe are sorry about any inconvenience this has caused, we are just as disappointed as you are.â The SPEC-TRUM directors were not immediately available for comment at the time of publication.The event comes after another near-cancellation of the Spring Fling headliner, Chance the Rapper, who considered backing out the day of the show due to illness but eventually decided to go on later than planned.\n",

            " Protesters marched through the city yesterday evening in response to the decisions not to indict police officers who killed unarmed black men in Ferguson, Mo., and in Staten Island, N.Y.   The protest started at 4 p.m. with a âDie Inâ at 30th Street Station â in which protesters laid down for four and a half minutes in reference to the four and half hours teenager Michael Brown laid in the street after being shot. The protest culminated in a march to City Hall where protesters remained for the rest of the evening.   The protests responded to last weekâs grand jury decision in Ferguson, Mo. not to indict Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot 18-year-old Michael Brown. They also resulted from yesterdayâs grand jury decision in Staten Island not to indict police officer Daniel Pantaleo, who placed Eric Garner â an unarmed man suspected of illegally selling cigarettes â in a fatal chokehold.      âI canât breathe,â the protesters chanted, echoing Garnerâs last words   The protest ended up clashing with a Christmas tree lighting at City Hall, which was planned for 8 p.m. âNo justice, no Christmas!â the crowd chanted as they walked around the Christmas tree.   There were many moments of anger when Christmas music being blasted on loudspeakers interrupted the protesters.   Many yelled, âShut it down, shut it down,â in response.   There were also moments of tension when performers, both young and old, came on stage. Some protestors continued to   yell their slogans, while others then became silent, at least for the younger performers. Others were upset at the performers who were black. One woman yelled for them to join in the protest and said they were âcrazyâ for being on stage.   âItâs a really difficult situation because we have something celebrating our young people but at the same time it feel so hypocritical to be singing âJingle Bell Rockâ when something so tragic is happening in our nation,â said Dyresha Harris, a 2005 College of Liberal and Professional Studies graduate. She was one of those who chose to be silent when kids were performing on stage.   âPeople here are trying to keep it in the news because thatâs the only way that people will continue to put effort into making something better,â she added.   Members of Students Organizing for Unity and Liberation organized a group of Penn students to join in. SOUL declined to comment for this article, as did other Penn students at the protest.   University Chaplain Charles Howard was also at the protest, though not in any official capacity. He said he has attended several protests since the Ferguson decision.   âIâm really proud of our students â the way they organized and the way theyâre pulling together and speaking out for justice,â he said.   Aside from the tension, many at the protest were glad to see how many people came out.   Travis McKinley, a protester who just moved to Philadelphia, joined the protest when the march passed his house. âI think itâs the first time that people have come together like this in a long time. The judicial system, itâs there to be objective and it hasnât been,â McKinley said. âI think the main point is to come together and show that we can make a difference.â     \n",

            "The show will go on at Franklin Field with Lupe Fiasco leading the Spring Fling lineup this year. The Social Planning and Events Committee announced Thursday that hip-hop artist Lupe Fiasco will headline the concert, which will also feature Ratatat and Flo Rida. Students have been speculating that Lupe Fiasco would perform at Fling since Feb. 18, when his website prematurely posted that he would be performing at Franklin Field on April 15 â the night of the Spring Fling concert. Wharton senior and SPEC President Adam Thompson explained that an uninformed intern at Lupe Fiascoâs record label posted the date on the website even though SPEC representatives and the artistâs agency were still in negotiations. âWe canât release rumors and at that time it was still very much a rumor,â Thompson said. Some students were confused by SPECâs decision to select Lupe Fiasco was the headliner as opposed to Flo Rida. âFlo Rida should have been the headliner,â College freshman Matt Brotman said. âHe has at least five huge hits â¦ Lupe doesnât have anything on the level of the âClub Canât Handle Me Now,â he added. College junior and SPEC Concerts co-director Shana Rusonis said Lupe was chosen as the headliner since it is âa high-profile time for Lupe Fiasco,â citing the release of his new album Lasers in early March and his upcoming spring college tour. She added that âalthough we have to call one an opener, this year we wanted a more equally weighted show.â âEach artist [in this yearâs lineup] is definitely a name in their own right,â Rusonis said. âIt doesnât necessarily need to be a hierarchy. It really just has to do with the order in which they perform in.â âOver the next month heâs only going to grow in popularity â¦ but heâs also a longstanding artist whoâs been in the industry,â she explained. âWe feel like he is a really good act to bring and Penn of all places will be a great audience for him,â Wharton sophomore and SPEC Concerts co-director Julia Sternfeld added. Other students were excited about the final addition of Lupe Fiasco to the Fling concert lineup. âHe is very talented,â College freshman Carolina Angel said. âHeâs one of the smartest rappers and he really has a way with words.â Although many students praised SPECâs choice of a headliner, most students were not surprised by the announcement. âEveryone knew it was going to be Lupe â¦ it was posted on his website,â College junior Aileen Palmer said. College freshman Marlee Stesin agreed. âIt was a little anticlimactic but Iâm still excited,â she said. Sternfeld said she was âdisappointedâ by the premature announcement âbecause we were planning an awesome release.â âBut overall, after it got out, we were happy with the response we got,â she added. Despite the early posting of Lupe Fiascoâs upcoming performance at Penn, SPEC members are confident in this addition to the Spring Fling lineup. âHe was chosen for his wide appeal, but he is also a little bit different then the straight-up rappers we have had in the past,â Thompson said.\n",

            "As the spring semester scrambles to a start, so too do student job searches. Many students are conducting their job hunts this year without the use of on-campus recruiting, a Career Services program that brings employers to Penn for on-campus interviews and recruitment presentation sessions. According to Kelly Cleary, a senior associate director for the College of Arts and Sciences at Career Services, the companies at OCR fairs âtend to be large employers that hire dozens or hundreds of summer interns â¦ companies that have very large university recruiting departments that can cover the expense of sending people out of the office for an entire day.â Those industries, Cleary said, are primarily finance, consumer products and retail, consulting and technology. Most other industries âhire only a handful of interns, so it just doesnât make senseâ for them to come to campus to recruit. Not Going the OCR Route Some students avoid using OCR because of this limited range of visiting companies. College sophomore Madeleine Stevens is conducting her own job search for summer internships because âit is [her] impression that OCR is for financial institutions.â Last year, this image of OCR spurred Stevens last year to look to other resources for her job search. She worked with the Center for Undergraduate Research and Fellowships to find a summer job as an historical research assistant through the Penn Undergraduate Research Mentoring Program. This year, she plans on again using CURF and also the online database iNet to seek summer employment. Cleary advocated the use of iNet as well as PennLink â which posts a multitude of internship and job positions accessible by PennKey â to both students who do not use OCR and those who do. Particularly useful for students not using OCR are the other online databases to which Career Services subscribes. Many of these databases post openings for nonprofit or think tank jobs, among others, that are not represented at OCR. These listings range from journalism jobs to international internships to policy positions. Cleary suggested that students using these online databases should âsearch by industry or by job type, not by major.â She added, âMost employers donât think about the major at all.â Thinking Out of the Box College senior and Africana studies major Marcel Salas attained a full-time job after graduation but, like Stevens, was ânever inclined to use OCRâ because she âassumed it was mostly for finance or econ-related fields.â Salas will be working for Red Bull in their Culture Marketing department in an 18-month rotational position, part of a selective âgraduate programâ similar to that of a banking firm. In this position, Salas will be analyzing âhow Red Bull produces all the media that we see, which is a big part of their marketing.â While Salas did not use OCR, she did employ the help of Career Services, at least in jump-starting her job search. âWhen I realized I wanted to do stuff in advertising and marketing, they directed me towards resources to learn more about the field,â Salas said. âI was super intimidated because I know kids here major in marketing and I knew we would be competing for the same jobs.â A more knowledgeable Salas then had the savvy to find a position on her own. She found out about the opportunity at Red Bull through another student at Penn. âI wouldnât have known about the graduate program had it not been for this other Penn student,â Salas said. It was the perfect âPenn connection.â OCR: A Stepping Stone College senior Isabel Friedman, soon to be working for the online media file hosting and sharing service Dropbox, found OCR to be helpful in her ultimate attainment of that position. Though she found the position at Dropbox using PennLink, she had previously used OCR in her job search for a consulting position. After going through the interviewing process and realizing consulting was not for her, Friedman said she walked away from OCR with stronger interviewing skills that were a stepping stone in finding a job. âMy experience preparing for consulting interviews and performing at interviews without a doubt helped me get the job that I ultimately got,â Friedman said. âOCR is daunting and itâs stressful, but it provided me invaluable experience in my own job search.â Beyond OCR, Career Services hosts both a spring fair and a start-up fair â usually in late February â for students looking for jobs that are not OCR positions, Cleary said. The spring fair is âthe largest fair of the year â¦ kind of the âalternatives to OCRâ career fair,â she added. Around 100 employers will be on campus for that event. With these and other Career Services initiatives, students do have alternatives to the OCR process. âI urge people not to feel alienated if [OCR] is not the right path for them and to know that there are a bunch of other resources out there,â Salas said. âDonât be scared if OCR is not your path.â\n",

            "Rebecca Steinâs Economics 001 class is going global. On April 8, students from all over the world will begin taking âPrinciples of Microeconomicsâ with Economics senior lecturer Rebecca Stein through Coursera. Currently, 13,040 people have already signed up for the course as of press time. Registration will continue until April 8. This course, which will last for nine weeks, consists of short eight- to 10-minute videos. At the end of each video, Stein will post questions that students are expected to answer. Each week students will also be expected to complete a multiple-choice quiz and a peer-assessment exercise. Additionally, Stein will conduct online Google chats with her students to discuss the subject. Through this forum, Stein also expects to receive different kinds of feedback than what she has received in her class at Penn thus far. âI think Iâm going to get a more international perspective through what students post on the forum,â Stein said. âIâll probably get much more detailed feedback, and it might help me rethink the way I teach things.â Although Stein is accustomed to teaching many students at a time â her lectures at Penn usually consist of a couple hundred studentsâ she anticipates that teaching an online course will be very different from teaching a lecture. She recognizes that because she is teaching an international group, she needs to âhookâ her students in a very different way. Stein said she expects the need to explain concepts in multiple ways in order to ensure that her students understand the material. She also understands that it will be challenging to teach students with whom she doesnât have offline interactions. âIâm used to having some of my students being passive, but Iâm also used to engaging students through assignments,â Stein said. Though she said she was anxious about teaching over 13,000 students, Stein is both eager and excited to teach through Coursera. âI am looking forward to how the Coursera course will inform and transform my in-class course,â Stein said. College freshman, Jacklyn Kornstein, who is currently enrolled in Steinâs course in microeconomics, spoke highly of Stein and the likely success of her course through Coursera.  âProfessor Stein is a great lecturer in the classroom,â Kornstein said. âI have listened to online recordings of her lectures as well and find them to be helpful and equally effective in conveying the material. I think students around the world would benefit from Internet lectures by Professor Stein on a larger scale using Courseraâ Stein also believes that teaching on Coursera will provide her with the opportunity to test the âflipped classroom modelâ which suggests that ideally, students should be watching the lectures at home and doing the homework and problems in the classroom. She hopes that family members of her students will try her course on Coursera. âI think this is a great opportunity for parents and siblings of my students to share in the experience,â Stein said. âItâs free, people should feel free to try it.â Penn started its partnership with Coursera last spring and launched its first course in June 2012. Twenty-two Penn faculty members have taught or are teaching courses through Coursera. According to Deirdre Woods, Interim Executive Director of Penn Open Learning Initiative, the Provostâs Office was particularly excited about asking Stein to teach. âRebecca is clearly an outstanding teacher in the College and clearly a person that we wanted to talk to,â Woods said. âShe was very excited about the prospect.â Woods explained that Stein is very effective in communicating the microeconomics principles through the video clips she has already filmed. âBeing able to take microeconomic principles and make them interesting and applicable in modern-day society is something that sheâs great at,â Woods said. Bolstered by positive feedback already received on other Penn courses offered through Coursera, Woods anticipates positive responses to Steinâs course as well.\n",

            "Social entrepreneurship now comes with a manual, thanks to Wharton professors. On June 18, 2013, Ian Macmillan, Dhirubhai Ambani professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at Wharton, and James Thompson, co-founder and director of the Wharton Social Enterprise Program, published the first section of their book âSocial Entrepreneurâs Playbook: Pressure Test Your Start-up Idea.â Their book, which is based on their thirteen years of field research with social enterprises, provides information to help social entrepreneurs launch their own ventures. The first installment of the book is available free online, which readers can download through ibooks, Amazon and Barnes & Noble. The second part of the book will become available in the fall. Related: Student publication to highlight community service Thompson said that he and his co-author were giving the book away for free in exchange for the readersâ participation in a survey on the book, which will close on July 15. The authors will use the themes and questions as âinputâ to âtweakâ the final version of the extended book. âIt is kind of a novel approach,â he said. The original research began with a discussion between Macmillan and Thompson about developing economics. At the time of the discussion, âsocial entrepreneurshipâ was not a popular topic. So they decided to conduct field research, learning about social enterprises on the ground with a case study basis. They worked with social entrepreneurs on âthe application of the business model with the knowledge of the operating model, funding and capacity,â Thompson explained. âThe key aspect of this book and social entrepreneurship is to apply the business discipline in the social enterprise,â he added. âThis kind of business mindset will produce self-efficiency for social enterprises and direct the groups which are dependent [to become independent].â This book has two focuses. The first is to âdo more with lessâ by teaching students how to maximize their social impact with âthe same amount of funding or fewer funding.â The second is the development of strategies to combat uncertain situations in social entrepreneurship. âSocial entrepreneurs operate in a highly uncertain environment â we designed the book in certain way, there is a way to play under high uncertainty,â Dr. Thompson said. Students have responded positively to the book thus far. Rising Wharton and Engineering junior Xiaolei Cong, who is on the executive board of Penn Social Entrepreneurship Mentorship, said he and most of his club members are planning to read it and contribute to the fall 2013 edition. âI think launching this first part of the book free for students is a great decision, since it shows that the authors are really receptive to the readers,â Cong said. He also said that the book has been helpful for PennSEM as well. âThe content of this book is also very new, as very few of the existing publications on social entrepreneurship discuss exactly how to build a social enterprise,â he said. âThis has been a challenge for our club as well, but I think this book will provide great help to those students at Penn who are interested in launching their social enterprise.â More: Entrepreneur stresses the value of socially sound business Rising Wharton junior Alex Dinsmoor, who is considering concentrating in Social Impact and Responsibility, also praised the book. âI think there are two skills you need for social entrepreneurship. One is to have the passion, the purpose like what type of change and feel deeply enough to create something. Second is to have the entrepreneurship skills to implement it. This book can guide you to fill in the weak area.â  He also enjoyed the bookâs practical, problem-solving approach. âMost of things we learned in class are perfect situations. But uncertain situations actually provide a better of what it will be actually like when starting a business.â\n",

            "Penn is offering a new introductory digital humanities course to give students a different path to pursue a minor in the subject.  Digital humanities is a discipline that uses technological tools to answer large-scale humanities questions. Since Penn launched a digital humanities minor two years ago, the number of students enrolling in core digital humanities courses has doubled, Price Lab for Digital Humanities Faculty Director Jim English said. To expand the program, a new introductory course will be offered in the spring, focusing on giving an overview of digital humanities as a discipline.  The new class, \"Introduction to Digital Humanities,\" will be taught by English professor Whitney Trettien. She said the course will serve as a softer entry point for humanities students to learn how to apply tools and technology to âbig pictureâ questions.  Students will engage in hands-on learning, will complete projects, and will visit Philadelphia institutions to see the ways humanists and scientists work together. The course is cross-listed as ENGL009, HIST009, and COML009, which Trettien said speaks to the versatility of skills it teaches.  English said digital humanities uses many techniques to address critical questions, ranging from spatial analysis and mapping to 3D reconstruction and text mining. Algorithmic techniques applied to literature, for instance, can find patterns of change indiscernible to a human reader to study issues like the evolution of descriptive terms around gender. Previously, English professor Scott Enderleâs course on using Python to solve literary and cultural problems was considered Penn's introductory digital humanities class. Trettien said this class, which has now been renumbered and renamed \"Introduction to Programming for Humanities,\" has traditionally attracted computer science students who are interested in humanities research. The new course hopes to do the opposite, introducing humanities students to computer science and computational analysis without expecting prior programming experience.   âI would like the digital humanities minor to become an interdisciplinary hub for students from multiple majors and departments and interests to interact with each other around shared questions and values,â Trettien said. College junior Joel Lee, who took Enderleâs course last spring, said it could be challenging as an introductory class because it included both programming skills and general information about the discipline.  âThe class that I took tried to combine both computational methods and an overview of digital humanities as a field, and in that sense it was a little bit hard to do both of those things at once,â Lee said. âI think itâll be really great that weâll have one class thatâs specifically more about digital humanities as a field.â Lee, who is minoring in digital humanities, said he feels the discipline provides an exciting intersection between computational work and humanities. As the program expands, however, he says he hopes to see more humanities students get involved in the field.  âNo one should feel as though programming is some kind of ominous thing that they canât do because theyâre humanities majors,â Lee said.  Trettien and English said while the aim of digital humanities as a discipline is to ask fundamental humanistic and ethical questions on a large scale, students also take away concrete technical skills and critical thinking that will help them communicate future research in a rapidly changing technological landscape. âDigital humanities at large is a movement that is transforming how we think about what universities can be and what learning can be in universities, and I want to use this class to step back and think about what that means,â Trettien said. âRight now â 2020 â whatâs happening? What will be the future of learning? What will be the future of creating? What will be the future of scholarship?â\n",

            "With the College topping the charts in course-size enrollment again this year, professors of large classes are finding new ways to engage students. According to the Office of the University Registrar, the top enrolled courses this semester are Psychology 001, Introduction to Experimental Psychology, and Economics 001, Introduction to Microeconomics. Apart from Marketing 101, Introduction to Marketing, in Wharton, all courses on this semesterâs top 10 enrollment list are in the College. While College Dean Dennis DeTurck noted that this list is fairly typical for Penn, some of the highest enrolled courses have made distinctive changes to their overall nature this year. For example, Mathematics 104 and Psychology 001 increased the use of technology this semester. In Mathematics 104, professors have begun using videos and podcasts to make lectures more accessible to students outside of class, said DeTurck, who teaches the course. Professors have also begun using systems like LectureTools â an online resource that allows students to answer and ask questions from a free account or from their phones, as opposed to clickers, he added. âItâs a technological moment when these courses can change a lot,â DeTurck said. âThese technologies are changing the nature of big lecture courses and this change can be good and bad â changing from the ground up.â DeTurck added that highly enrolled courses like Mathematics 104 are âthe Brussels sprouts of the curriculum. Itâs something you have to do to learn the basics. Professors think about these courses all the time because so many students are taking them and we are always trying to make them better and more interesting.â In Psychology 001, professors have increased the use of clickers to track student attendance and performance. For Psychology 001 professor Paul Rozin, these technological additions have changed courses both for better and for worse. âTechnology has two sides,â said Rozin, who experimented with online exams for the first time ever last semester. âIt allows for personalization and the efficient delivery of course material, but also has increased cheating, as with the online exams, and makes people have higher expectations of how entertaining and constantly engaging lectures with technology should be.â Another top-enrolled course, Economics 001, has also made several additions to accommodate new practices among students. Last semester, Economics 001 professor Rebecca Stein implemented a new program called âGREATâ â Groups for Economic Applied Thinking â which took place outside of lecture and allowed for students to solve problems with upper-class mentors that allowed them to make real-world applications. While Stein said she felt that students were pleased with the new program, some who took the course last semester, like College freshman Nick Hailey, felt the program lacked in certain aspects. Sometimes, Hailey said, the upperclassman mentors would not know the answers to the problems they were trying to solve, and he would leave the group with âunanswered questions, especially because I could not contact the professor, due to the size of the class and the number of students trying to ask her questions.â Overall, Hailey feels that such popular, introductory-level courses are improving, but still have much room for improvement. âTeachers are getting better at teaching a class with time,â Hailey said. âThey are learning what works and learning from experience what changes to make and what to keep.â Though courses like Economics 001 and Psychology 001 are typically taken by underclassmen to fill requirements or gauge interest in a particular field, some upperclassmen have expressed similar opinions. âThese courses give you cocktail-party knowledge,â College junior Robert Gard said. âThe whole point of requirements is to expand interests, to provide a chance for freshmen and sophomores to explore what they may be interested in and find things they were never interested in before. These courses are fair, but can always make the subject matter more interesting and relevant.â\n",

            "The Y-Prize is back, and this time the world is invited to compete. A joint venture between the Mack Institute at the Wharton School and the GRASP Lab at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Y-Prize is a competition that challenges contestants to create applications for three robotic technologies developed by Penn professors.  This is the second year of the competition, and unlike last year, when it was open to only Penn students, anyone in the world can now compete. This is because of Y-Prizeâs partnership with Marblar, an online crowdsourcing platform where users can submit their ideas to be refined into an actual product by an online community. The Y-Prize will consists of two rounds, a research stage which is going on now and a development stage in December. Teams with the most promising ideas from the research stage with be selected to enter the development stage, when they will receive money and business and technical advice to help them create a business plan, which they will then pitch to a panel of judges. The winning team will receive $5,000 and the opportunity to pitch their idea to intellectual property commercialization company IP Group. Related: Wharton and Engineering School collaborate on Y-Prize The University will retain 10 percent of any commercial application created through the Y-Prize. Saikat Chaudhuri, executive director of the Mack Institute at Wharton, also sees the Y-Prize as a way to âfoster more collaboration between the different schools,â as well as to âconnect scholars with industry and students.â Chaudhuri says the new partnership with Marblar this year is âtapping into a whole innovation ecosystem â¦ itâs that platform that weâre really interested in building.â Engineering professor Vijay Kumarâs flying robots, called quadrotors, are one of the Y-Prize technologies that groups are asked to develop applications for. Notable for their agility and ability to cooperate with one another, the robots have a great potential for âsearch and rescue and first response,â Kumar said. However, he encourages contestants to âcome up with something completely different. I would love to see something that would really benefit society.â Kumar, also one of the original founders of the Y-Prize, remembers âlamenting [about] the inefficiency of the university in commercializing technology.â This spurred the idea of the Y-Prize. âWe were trying to figure out how to get the Penn community at large involved in brainstorming about ideas,â he said. Mark Yim, faculty director of the Weiss Tech House and an Engineering professor, said that for many technologies the biggest problem is that âwe donât know what to do with them.â He cites his own work, self-reconfigurable modular robots, which is one of the three robotic technologies featured in the competition that teams are asked to apply, as an example. âI think itâs a good integration of all the engineering majors, and itâs interdisciplinary with Wharton,â said current Y-Prize contestant Stephanie Gedal, an Engineering sophomore. âOur strategy is to have a team that is really experienced in many different facets and also to not be afraid of executing our ideas.â Kelsey Duncombe-Smith, an Engineering junior and part of last yearâs winning team, urges participants to think about the business aspect of the Y-Prize.âMake sure that you believe in your idea and that you can see yourself pursuing it beyond the competition.â If this yearâs competition is successful, Chaudhuri sees the possibility for the Y-Prize to expand even more. He suggests as example holding the Y-Prize competition more than once a year, among other changes. âThereâs nothing against doing a different technology next year. Why not nanotech? Take it further.â\n",

            " As Wharton is poised to begin a review of its undergraduate curriculum, student leaders have differing opinions on what can be improved, though there seems to be a consensus on the value of business fundamentals and other required courses.   Matthew DeGagne, a Wharton senior who is the co-president of Wharton Ambassadors, praised the core curriculum, which includes introductory management, accounting, statistics, finance, marketing and operations and information management.   âThe core is a really fundamental preparation for classes later on and for professional development. It allows for a lot of flexibility, which is something that Iâve definitely appreciated throughout my time here,â DeGagne said, noting that he did not speak on behalf of all Wharton Ambassadors.   Though he likes the flexibility allowed when navigating the core, DeGagne isnât sure that all students are aware of the alternate pathways to fulfill requirements. He would like to see increased promotion of these opportunities â such as a qualitative path, a quantitative path or a custom one of studentsâ own choosing.   DeGagne also suggested adding a technology or entrepreneurship requirement to the curriculum, as well as expanding opportunities for business breadth courses and better integrating research into Wharton courses.   After serving as TAs for several courses together, Wharton seniors Frank Ragusa and Nathan Barzideh have spent a significant amount of time evaluating the Wharton curriculum. While they agree about the importance of the core, they strongly feel that the curriculum structure needs increased flexibility. Ragusa and Barzideh point to the Wharton MBA curriculum review, led by legal studies professor G. Richard Shell and implemented throughout 2011 and 2012, as a good example for the undergraduate review to follow.   âGoing forward, there should be a focus on enhancing flexibility in the curriculum, which is something they did at the MBA level,â Barzideh said. âMirroring that closely at the undergraduate level would be fantastic.â   Ragusa added that repetition between courses    should be addressed, with courses like Management 101 and Management 104 having too much overlap.   âThere tends to be a little bit of redundancy in courses, so sometimes students find themselves learning the same thing two or three times which creates a little bit of frustration,â Ragusa said.   Both Barzideh and Ragusa believe in the importance of liberal arts to the Wharton experience and feel that it should be further incorporated into the core curriculum. The opportunity to take courses outside of Wharton contributes to a balanced student experience, they said.   â[Billionaire investor] Carl Icahn was a philosophy major at Princeton because it taught him how to think critically. Some successful hedge fund and private equity fund managers took English because theyâre able to communicate ideas to investors and their colleagues,â Ragusa said. âIf the core took these things into account, that would add tremendous value for the curriculum.â   With the beginning of Geoffrey Garrettâs deanship, Ragusa and Barzideh are optimistic for the outcome of the review. But they stressed that student representation is crucial during the review process.   âIt is absolutely imperative that there be a strong student voice at the table,â Barzideh said. âIf you really want a curriculum re-evaluation that makes a meaningful impact, itâs so important to have the people that are the beneficiaries of the changes to communicate their views to other stakeholders.â  \n",

            "Consulting is usually associated with opulence and constant traveling, yet thousands of Penn students seek consulting jobs every year for more than superficial motivations.âPeople like the breadth of the industry and the breadth of the business problems you work on. Every few months, you have a new project and a new client. You are learning about new industries and developing new skills,â Director of Career Services Patricia Rose said. âThis is very attractive to graduates who are just starting out and donât have much experience with any particular industry.âCollege junior Joy Zhang will intern with Deloitte Consulting this summer. Part of her duty during the internship will be to research on compensation structure for company employees, a topic related to her studies in psychology and economics. Before the internship, Zhangâs first experience with consulting was a public policy case competition, held by the Philadelphia mayoral office to help solve the problem of millennial retention.âConsulting is a great learning opportunity to explore different areas. You can work on different projects involving different industries. I want to start broad as a generalist and then get more narrow through time,â she said. âConsulting also gives me a sense of responsibility to solve real problems for my clients, and you can interact with other bright people from different backgrounds.âWharton and College sophomore Chris Wu said consulting is a good âentry pointâ for fresh graduates to figure out their career passions, but this might not necessarily be a positive trend. âThe industry is very general, so you can of course learn a lot of things, but I think that consulting has turned into a vortex that sucks people in. It feels like if you donât know what you want to do, you just go do consulting,â he said. âI think itâs better to be purposeful and have a reason for why you are doing your job.âAccording to career plan survey reports from Career Services, consulting has consistently ranked as the second-most-popular job â after investment banking â pursued by Penn students.And the industry appeals to more than just Wharton students. For majors ranging from chemical engineering to philosophy, politics and economics, consulting firms are constantly the top hirers.âConsulting actually draws on people from different backgrounds. The diversity is what the clients are paying for. They want to have people with different ideas to help with their problems,â said College and Wharton senior Linda Li, who was the former vice president of the Wharton Undergraduate Consulting Club. Li will take a full-time job offer for a consulting firm in New York after she graduates.Students are also attracted to the broad range of consulting firms that exist. âWe normally think of consulting as management consulting and firms like McKinsey  and the Boston Consulting Group,â Rose said. âBut there [is] pharmaceutical consulting, technology consulting and so on. There are different firms doing different work that have particular niches. Thatâs why you see consulting attracting students from all majors.âStatistics have shown that, in the past few years, the share of consulting in Penn studentsâ post-graduation plans has been shrinking slightly year by year, partly due to the rise of technology related careers and start-ups. Nevertheless, Rose said consulting will remain popular for the foreseeable future.âI have been here for 30 years, and consulting has been popular since I got here,â she said. âThere will always be consulting and it will always be a popular career choice.â\n",

            "The fourth-annual Y-Prize â a competition in which teams propose innovative commercial applications for technology invented by Penn researchers â will hold its kick-off event on Monday.The Y-Prize is a competition in which students examine the intersection of engineering and business, find applications for cutting-edge technologies and step into the shoes of budding entrepreneurs. Instead of coming up with innovative solutions for problems, participants need to identify problems for the technology to solve.This year, coordinators restructured  the design of the Y-Prize. Though the technologies were âmore strictly just engineeringâ in the past, theyâve branched into the field of biomedical engineering this year âusing technologies that were developed in a medical context, but really can have applications that go far beyond that field,â as Michelle Eckert, marketing and communications coordinator of the Mack Institute for Innovation Management, put it.The competition has two phases: In the first phase, each  team submits a video pitch and slide deck online illustrating an idea for an application of Y-Prize technology. Finalists, who are announced on Nov. 20, enter the second phase, in which they present their ideas to a panel of industry leaders who decide the winning team that will receive a prize of $10,000.Many of the ideas generated during past years have been developed into innovative and successful companies. The winners of the 2012-13 Y-Prize were 2015 Engineering graduate Dick Zhang and 2016 Wharton Ph.D. student Andy Wuof Identified Technologies. Their idea was to use self-piloting aerial survey drones for land surveying and aerial mapping.âToday, weâre a fully operational company,â Zhang said. He largely attributed his companyâs success to the Y-Prize, saying that if it werenât for this competition, he âmost certainly would not have pursued this kind of entrepreneurial work.âThe winners of the 2014-15 competition were 2015 Wharton and Engineering graduates Ashwin Amurthur and Teddy Guenin of Graphene Field Effect Transistor-Track Technologies. They utilized graphene, a patented nanotechnology developed by Penn Engineering professor A. T. Charlie Johnson, to invent the graphene field effect transistor, which detects leaks during fracking.Previous winners offered words of wisdom  for future competitors. Zhang reflected that storytelling was one skill he realized was important during the competition .âEffectively telling a story in the 10 minutes for your pitch and keeping compelling aspects in your story is probably the most important of skills that you could work on,â Zhang said. Guenin added that competitors should âthink outside the box on whatever the technology could be used for because the ideas the judges are really going to like are going to be the nonobvious ones.â\n",

            "The Wharton School recently hired award-winning professor Cait Lamberton from the University of Pittsburgh to teach in its Marketing Department. Lamberton will serve as the inaugural Alberto I. Duran Presidentâs Distinguished Professor in Whartonâs Marketing Department. Lamberton previously taught at the University of Pittsburgh for more than 10 years. In 2015, Lamberton made Poets & Quantsâ Top 40 Business School Professors under 40 list.  Lamberton placed third in Fortuneâs Top 10 Business School Professors under 40 list in the same year. Lamberton said the opportunity to work at Penn jumped out to her because of Wharton's vast resources, which will allow her to pursue risk management and consumer psychology. âSomething that I am really looking forward to is developing some really broad research programs,â Lamberton said. âThe vast amount of resources at Penn allow you to study bigger and messier questions that are not possible in places where resources are more constrained.â While Lamberton will be primarily teaching MBA and Ph.D. courses in the upcoming spring semester, Lamberton said she looks forward to teaching undergraduate courses in the future, possibly as soon as fall 2020. âI am excited to teach undergrads because they are so open-minded and are interested in a lot of different topics, so we can explore a wide range of perspectives,â Lamberton said. âThe fact that undergraduate students are bringing this wide range of interest makes [the course] a lot of fun.â Lamberton initially received her bachelor's degree in English from Wheaton College, and she moved on to receive an MBA and Ph.D. in Business Administration from the University of South Carolina. But Lamberton says she wasn't always set on the world of business.  âI was an English major in undergrad, and I love the English major because it exposed me to all different ways to live in the world,â Lamberton said. Lamberton said she decided to study marketing and consumer psychology in graduate school because of the universal nature of the subjects. âThere is almost nothing in the world that we can talk about without talking about consumer psychology and marketing,â Lamberton said. Wharton Vice Dean of Analytics Eric Bradlow said the Marketing Department has been looking for accomplished scholars and educators, which led to Lamberton's hiring. âCaitâs name emerged from the top of that list. This list is based on publication record, teaching accomplishments, visibility and leadership in the field, record of working with Ph.D. students, and potential synergy with Wharton,â Bradlow said. Lamberton said she enjoyed her time at the University of Pittsburgh because of the large proportion of first-generation students at the university, which, she said, âcreates a very different kind of drive.\" Even though she was only officially hired this summer, Lamberton has already heard from Penn students and is excited to begin teaching. âUndergraduate students here at Penn have very big goals, and I have already gotten emails from students who are interested in starting their own companies,â Lamberton said. Lamberton said the motivated nature of Penn's students presents an opportunity to work with ambitious students, while also posing a responsibility to guide these students through the learning process. âIt is wonderful to work with people with big ideas, but it is important to make sure that people pursue those things without undermining other aspects of life,â Lamberton said. Bradlow said Lamberton is a future leader in the Marketing Department and Wharton as a whole. âWe felt that Cait had the potential to help us continually build our group, be a thought leader, excel in the classroom and training of Ph.D. students, and her work on technology and consumer marketing is a forward-looking and rapidly growing area of our field,â Bradlow added.\n",

            "SEPTA announced Thursday in a press release that they will borrow $175 million dollars from the nonprofit Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation to implement an electronic fare system that can abolish tokens once and for all. College freshman Jen Chaquette rides the SEPTA biweekly to her internship in Center City. Her only criticism of the current rail system was its outdated technology. âThe only thing I wish they had now is some sort of pass so I do not have to pay cash or carry tons of tokens,â she said. âItâs very annoying.â The smart card system will allow SEPTA riders to purchase tickets on the train from bank cards, mobile devices and other âsmartâ technologies. âTodayâs action by the SEPTA Board marks a major milestone in our efforts to provide our loyal customers with state-of-the-art, convenient and efficient service,â SEPTA General Manager Joseph M. Casey said in the boardâs press release. The SEPTA Board also borrowed $250 million in federal bonds to add 120 new Regional Rail railcars to the current fleet, as well as renovate 110-year-old Wayne Junction station, located at 4481 Wayne Ave. in North Philadelphia. According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, the total stimulus of $425 million dollars is the largest debt SEPTA has ever taken. College junior Ben Moskowitz, a native of a Washington, D.C. suburb, said he considers SEPTA transportation unreliable. âOne of the things with the Washington Metro system is that is much more technologically friendly,â Moskowitz said. âI can time when to leave my house and leave work based on when the next train comes,â he said, adding that âit sounds like SEPTA could be on its way there.â Although Moskowitz prefers the transit system of Washington D.C. to SEPTAâs, he notes that this comes with a price. âItâs significantly better, but itâs significantly more expensiveâ in D.C., where the cost of a subway ride ranges from $1.60 to $5.00. âYouâre paying for the quality,â Moskowitz said. However, SEPTA noted in the same press release that these renovations will not increase ticket prices.\n",

            "While the two-year reconstruction of the South Street Bridge had many University City residents seeing red, some South Street businesses found it difficult to stay out of the red. âWe nearly died when the bridge closed,â said Jessie Frisby, owner of Jessieâs Herbal Essence and Boutique and president of the South Street West Business Association. âItâs still questionable whether weâre going to make it or not.â Frisby, who has been a South Street shop owner for over 40 years, said owning her building at 1537 South St., rather than renting, gave her âreason to hold on a little longer.â The South Street Bridge construction, which began in December 2008 and was completed Saturday, required detours to be mapped out that led cars away from Frisbyâs neighborhood. Because her business depends more on vehicle traffic than foot traffic, she explained, these reroutes took a toll on her customer base. To celebrate the bridgeâs reopening, some stores offered specials. Consignment store Sophisticated Seconds, located at 2204 South St., treated customers to a 10-percent discount and free food. Frisby hopes the bridgeâs reopening will bring car traffic back to her neighborhood. However, she believes parking problems will affect the future of her business, as she worries that potential customers are deterred by a lack of spaces. Frisby hopes her store and others around it will receive some assistance from the city. She said she believes there is a lot that still needs to be done for these stores, including economic help from city government. âWeâve got a new bridge but we, the shop owners, also need a new face,â she added. Emily Patz, assistant manager at Retrospect, a vintage clothing store, said most of the storeâs clientele live in the neighborhood. Because Retrospect is further east, at 534 South St., it did not suffer from the bridgeâs closing. âI donât even know where the South Street Bridge is,â she said.\n",

            "SEPTAâs new smart fare card system will soon be more widespread, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. The SEPTA Key card will see a city-wide release this week, after a test run of the system on Feb. 9 at the 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby.The SEPTA Key card was first introduced in a pilot introduction in June 2016 and has since been used for five million trips. The organization is in the process of providing the card at all subway stations and major bus loops. The expansion is planned to continue throughout early March. SEPTA officials told the Inquirer that the transport organization is aiming to âphase out other fare modes completely, including tokens,â but that the process of transitioning into using solely the Key card depends on how fast users adopt the card. When the card was first introduced, the organization placed a limit on how many rides someone with the card would be able to take. This limit has since been increased in response to feedback from a public hearing process, according to Phillymag. \"As the cards become available through kiosks at other stations, riders will have to initially pay for a monthly or weekly pass to get the card. Once purchased, though, the card offers flexibility,\" the Inquirer article states. \"Users can maintain a 'travel wallet' on it, allowing them to pay per ride, will be able to reload the card online or through a smart phone, and can register the card to protect its balance if it is lost.\" \n",

            "Ten cents more for a subway ride may not seem like much. Over time, though, those extra dimes can add up. Thatâs certainly SEPTAâs intention. By planning to raise the price of tokens for buses, subways and trolleys by 10 cents, as well as making other fare increases, SEPTA could raise an estimated $22 million in additional revenue. But the fare hike will also add up for the customers who use Philadelphiaâs very lackluster public-transportation system to get to work â  and for the Penn students who use SEPTA for everything from internship commutes to quick rides to restaurants. Weâre not criticizing SEPTA for raising fares. Itâs not a bad idea â that is, if SEPTA uses the money it raises from the increase to make necessary renovations.  If SEPTA is going to institute a fare hike, no matter how small, it needs to improve the quality of its service. Renovations to SEPTA are long overdue. Vehicles could use upgrades, stations could be cleaner and a card-swipe method of paying for rides would make traveling less of a hassle. When judged against other cities, such as New York and Washington, SEPTAâs quality and convenience pales in comparison. SEPTA provides a valuable service to the city. The inconvenience caused by SEPTAâs shutdown during the strike last fall proves just how valuable. Improving the system could only make it more important to city residents. A fare increase must do more than take a toll on residents.\n",

            "This fall, lower prices and a greater variety are coming to The Fresh Grocer. The grocery chain announced over the summer that it will be joining the Wakefern Food Cooperative, whose members own and operate ShopRite grocery stores. The 40th and Walnut Street grocery store will maintain its current branding, hours and management. Starting on Oct. 1, however, the store will implement parts of the Wakefern program. Through the new partnership, FroGro executives say, in-store costs will likely decrease because of new pricing strategies. Other changes to The Fresh Grocer will include updated online shopping features and a mobile app. âBeing part of a co-op increases our buying power,â Fresh Grocer Marketing Director Carly Spross said. âWe can pass that on to our customers.â While The Fresh Grocer in Drexel Hill will become a ShopRite in September, the rest of the stores in the chain will still be called The Fresh Grocer. Other than changes to cost and variety, nothing new is expected at Pennâs FroGro. Even when the changes take effect in October, the store will continue to remain open 24 hours. âWith several stores strategically located near college campuses, The Fresh Grocer will give us new insight into the next generation of consumers and will expand our reach to a new customer,â Wakefern President and COO Joe Sheridan said in a prepared statement. \n",

            "The South Street Bridgeâs reopening will make the lives of many in the Philadelphia area easier. The addition of another route across the Schuylkill River will reduce commutersâ driving time and will bring traffic to businesses and attractions near the bridgeâs ends. The easier access to retail near the bridge is particularly important. While the bridge was in dire need of renovations, some businesses suffered financially because of its temporary closure. The city helped to minimize the damages to area sites and stores by impressively finishing the construction ahead of schedule. But its work doesnât stop just because the bridge is open again. The Philadelphia government needs to ensure that it markets the attractions near the bridge well â perhaps by coordinating special events in the area. The businesses themselves have taken some initiative to attract customers. A number of stores offered discounts to celebrate the reopening. Still, stores would benefit from additional assistance from the city. Considering that businesses have suffered as of late, though, special sales and giveaways canât last forever. And stores have uphill battles ahead of them because many Philadelphians have gotten used to taking other routes and frequenting other restaurants and retail spaces. Now that the bridge has reopened, the city should do as much as possible to revitalize area stores. Donât drop the ball. \n",

            "Soon, Penn students may be able to buy hard liquor along with their cereal at the Fresh Grocer. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board announced last month that they will be running a pilot program to sell hard liquor to some of the current wine kiosks across the state. However, there is no current time line for when the program will be put in place â nor is there a plan for determining which grocery stores will test it out and what types of liquor will be sold, PLCB spokeswoman Stacey Witalec wrote in an email. But if the pilot program is a success, all Pennsylvania grocery stores with wine kiosks will expand to include spirits, Witalec added. According to Carly Spross, the Fresh Grocerâs spokeswoman, they have no say in whether or not a kiosk for spirits will be added to their location. She added, however, that the wine kiosk at the 40th and Walnut location is one of the best-selling ones. âI personally really like it a lot,â College junior Alexandra Crooks said, regarding the kiosk. âFrogro is a lot more convenient and safe â sometimes I donât feel safe walking all the way to Market Street alone at night.â The wine kiosks were first installed in grocery stores around the country after a pilot program last summer. Fresh Grocer had a kiosk installed in September 2010 following a small-scale introduction to two Pennsylvania grocery stores in June.\n",

            "This November, Philadelphians are on track to have something very big to be thankful for â the completion of the South Street Bridge reconstruction. The project is still on schedule and is expected to be completed on-time and on-budget. After many delays on the start of construction and the inconvenience the bridgeâs closing has caused, we are very grateful for the timely progress and economic efficiency. The city has been planning the bridgeâs reconstruction since 1995, but the project was delayed multiple times because it had to be coordinated in conjunction with many organizations. Even after the construction started, there was potential for problems; changes had to be made to the original design for the bridgeâs towers. While a new bridge was necessary, the bridgeâs closing certainly hasnât made life easy for commuters and pedestrians. Since it was closed in December 2008, traffic has increased on other bridges and a bus route was diverted. The less time people have to be inconvenienced, the better. Philadelphia has not had an easy time financially in the past year. The fact that the construction is not running up extra costs is more than welcome. We look forward to the bridgeâs opening and the easier trips to Center City.\n",

            "SEPTA will start phasing out tokens in early 2014, but that doesnât mean riders will be paying the same fare then as they do now. Both token and cash fare increases are set to take effect on July 1, should SEPTAâs newest budget be approved by the agencyâs board. The cost of both token and cash fare will jump by 25 cents, to $1.80 and $2.25, respectively. Once the system phases in its new payment technology, which will use fare cards and other microchip-equipped devices, cash fare will increase to $2.50. SEPTA spokesperson Andrew Busch attributed the fare hike to the need for new revenue and changing state law. âLike all public transportation operations, we receive a significant amount of money from state subsidies to fund our operating costs,â Busch said. âBut itâs also our responsibility to do as much as possible to increase the amount of money we have to pay for our operating costs and to not overburden our customers.â Revenue is currently 1.8 percent below SEPTAâs year-to-date budget, and the system has accommodated 3.21 million fewer rides this year than last year, according to SEPTAâs Revenue and Ridership Report. The last increase came in 2010 as part of a 2007 plan to raise fares every three years. This is the first time since 2001, however, that cash fare has increased, Busch said. âThatâs pretty annoying, because most people donât carry around quarters,â Wharton sophomore Diliana Dimitrova said, who uses SEPTA about twice per week to travel to a Center City internship. âI already have a hard time finding $2 to pay for it because I usually just have my card.â Since SEPTA cashiers only accept exact fare, riders who only have bills will be forced to pay $3 instead of $2. Busch cited that as one of the benefits of the new payment system, where riders can use a  card or smartphone to pay the $1.80 fare instead. âWhen [the new system] comes along, if somebody has a $5 bill, theyâll be able to put that into a vending machine to get a smart card,â Busch said. The new system will be phased into the Broad Street line, Market-Frankford line and trolley routes in spring of 2014. When it is first rolled out, riders will be able to pay with a card, phone, tokens or cash. âThatâs the most annoying part of going â constantly having to worry about tokens,â College senior Amanda Johnson said, who rides the SEPTA trolley about four times per week to volunteer at KIPP West Philadelphia Preparatory Charter as part of a student group. âThat would eliminate the extra half hour I sometimes plan on having to get tokens.â The city will be among the first to implement the new smart chip technology. Several other transit systems, including those in New York and Chicago, are in the process of developing similar payment methods. âWe believe that within a few years, most people will have something in their wallet thatâs equipped with the technology theyâre going to be able to use on SEPTA,â Busch said. âFrom around the industry, weâre hearing that this is where fare payment is going in the future.â While Johnson wonât be in Philadelphia next year to regularly use the new payment system, she said she is pleased to see the system modernizing. âStructurally, they have a good public transportation system â itâs really just the fare that people complain about,â Johnson said. âIt stinks that I wonât be around for it, but Iâm glad theyâre finally doing it.â\n",

            "On Friday, SEPTA announced plans to raise fares by approximately six percent in its budget proposal for the next fiscal year, among other changes. If approved, the fare hikes would be the agencyâs first since 2007, and would take effect July 1. Under the proposal, the cost of a token â usable in SEPTAâs bus, subway and trolley systems â would rise from $1.45 to $1.55. The cash fare would remain the same, at $2.00 per ride, and the cost of a transfer would rise from $0.75 to $1.00. The transit agency will hold a series of public hearings from April 14-20 on the proposed budget, after which the SEPTA board will vote to approve or deny it. Though the changes, according to the proposal, will generate an estimated $22 million in additional revenue, SEPTA Chief Financial Officer Richard Burnfield told The Philadelphia Inquirer he expects ridership to decline almost two percent as a result of fare increases. âAny time thereâs a fare hike, thereâs always some public displeasure over having to pay more, especially in this economy,â SEPTA Youth Advisory Council Chairman and College senior Phil Dawson said. But Dawson said he expected the impact of hikes to be âminimalâ for students, since token prices will only rise 10 cents and the cash fare will remain the same.\n",

            "In the wake of the decision in Windsor v. U.S. â which declared the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional â lawsuits dealing with same-sex marriage have been filed in states across the country, from Kentucky to New Mexico to here in Pennsylvania. Currently, there are at least two court cases in Pennsylvania, and one proposed bill in Harrisburg, that deal with same-sex marriage in the state. In one court case before a Pennsylvania Commonwealth court, the state is asking for the Montgomery County Register of Wills to stop issuing same-sex marriage licenses, because it violates state laws. In another case before a federal district court, the American Civil Liberties Union is asking for Pennsylvaniaâs same-sex marriage ban to be overturned as unconstitutional. The newly proposed Pennsylvania House bill, on the other hand, attempts to reform current same-sex marriage restrictions in the state. The Daily Pennsylvanian took a look at what each of these projects are trying to achieve, and what could come of them: Whitewood v. Corbett July 9, 2013 â The ACLU of Pennsylvania, along with independent counselors that included Law School professor Seth Kreimer, filed suit in federal court against Pennsylvaniaâs top officials on behalf of 23 plaintiffs who were denied certain rights under Pennsylvaniaâs current same-sex marriage law. Two of the plaintiffs, Len Reiser and Fernando Chang-Muy, are lecturers at Penn Law who have been a couple for over 32 years. Both Reiser and Chang-Muy said in an interview with the DP in July that they want the state to âacknowledge what isâ â that they are a married couple as they have acted in all respects as a married couple would. Related: Law lecturers sue Gov. Corbett for right to marriage Already, one of the defendants in the suit, Attorney General Kathleen Kane, said that she will not defend the stateâs officials being sued â including Gov. Tom Corbett â because she âcannot ethically defend the constitutionality of Pennsylvaniaâs DOMA.â In response, Corbettâs Office of General Counsel has said that it will defend him and the other state officials charged in the suit. While there has not been much recent court action involving the Whitewood case, a stipulation between the opposing parties indicates that Corbett and the other defendants have until Sept. 30 to respond to the ACLUâs complaint. Pa. Health Department v. Hanes July 30, 2013 â Corbettâs office filed suit against Montgomery County Register of Wills D. Bruce Hanes, asking a Commonwealth court to stop him from issuing further same-sex marriage licenses. On Sept. 12, the judge hearing the case against Hanes ruled that the Register of Wills must comply with Pennsylvaniaâs current Marriage Law, and that he must âcease and desist from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex applicants,â according to court records. Related: Pa. official sued for issuing same-sex marriage licenses Prior to the courtâs ruling, Hanes had issued 174 marriage licenses to same-sex couples. While Pennsylvania General Counsel James Schultz, who represented Corbett in the suit against Hanes, said that he âappreciate[d] the courtâs consideration of the legal and social complexities of this issue,â the Montgomery County Solicitor said that he will file an appeal of the decision on behalf of Hanes in the coming days. Federal v. State Whatâs important to note about these cases, though, is that while Hanesâ case is being heard by a state court, a federal court is hearing the Whitewood case. This means âif the Whitewood plaintiffs win and a federal court says that Pennsylvania is required to recognize same-sex marriages, then Hanes will presumably win his case,â or the Department of Health will drop the suit, Penn Law professor Kermit Roosevelt said in an email. Roosevelt, however, added that âeven if the Hanes court does decide the constitutional issueâ of whether he can use discretion to interpret the Pennsylvania constitution differently than the Department of Health, his case is a state case âand wouldnât affect a federal courtâs decision of a federal constitutional issue.â House Bill 1647 Sept. 9, 2013 â While some parties have chosen to settle questions related to same-sex marriage through the courts, State Rep. Mark Cohen (D-Philadelphia) and State Rep. Michelle Brownlee (D-Philadelphia), among others, have joined together to introduce legislation to change Pennsylvaniaâs current marriage laws. While House Bill 1647 would not explicitly allow state officials to perform same-sex marriages, it would recognize any same-sex marriages that were performed outside of Pennsylvania. Related: Tax status complicated for same-sex couples The bill would also allow religious sects that did not wish to perform same-sex marriages the opportunity to refrain from doing so. âIt certainly is an uphill battle in Pennsylvania to pass this with the Republicans in control of the legislature,â Cohen said. However, he noted that âmembers of the LGBT community deserve to have the marriages they choose â¦ They should have the full legal rights that heterosexual people [currently] have.â\n",

            "Despite President Trumpâs anti-immigrant rhetoric during both his campaign and while in office, his administration last week ruled to allow more than 750,000 undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States â at least temporarily.Penn students, while relieved at the ruling, are hesitant to celebrate just yet.Trump said in a June 16 memo that he plans to continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects âdreamersâ â individuals who entered the United States as children. However, White House officials have been quick to emphasize that this is just a temporary ruling.âThere has been no final determination made about the DACA program, which the president has stressed needs to be handled with compassion and with heart,â said Jonathan Hoffman, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security.Pennâs administration was pleased with Trumpâs turn on DACA.âWe are glad that President Trump has expressed this new position,â University spokesman Stephen MacCarthy said in a statement.Penn has been outspoken in favor of immigrant rights in the past. After several petitions from student groups last year, Penn declared itself a âsanctuaryâ for undocumented students, in a letter sent by top administrators, including Penn President Amy Gutmann.In the Nov. 30 letter, Penn affirmed that the University wouldnât allow immigration officers on campus without a proper warrant, or proffer any information about undocumented students without proper legal proceedings.Frank Calabrese, a former immigration lawyer and the associate director of Pennâs International Student and Scholar Services said DACA is a worthwhile measure that provides individuals âhope and a means to come out of hiding.âBut Calabrese added that he did not consider this any great victory, as Trump made no definitive statement on the permanent status of DACA.âThis could change. Who knows? I think the presidentâs a little bit erratic in whatâs going on, and the thing with DACA is that it doesnât necessarily work,â he said. âItâs not a pass to a green card.âBesides, the extension of DACA doesnât solve all the problems that undocumented immigrants face, according to Erik Vargas, a rising College sophomore and media liaison of Penn for Immigrant Rights. Many students at Penn protected under DACA still fear for the potential separation of their families if they have undocumented, and thus unprotected, parents, he said.Vargas noted that there are also Penn students who are citizens but have undocumented parents. Like many DACA students, they too face the threat of homelessness if their parents are deported.Vargas said he is particularly worried about potential legislation in his home state of Texas. According to The Los Angeles Times, Texas legislators have already passed a bill that allows local law enforcement to request the immigration status of anyone they arrest for any type of felony. The state has also passed laws punishing local police who ignore federal immigration requests to detain suspected undocumented immigrants.The bill is supposed to go into effect on Sept. 1, but five large Texas cities such as Houston, Dallas and Austin have challenged it, halting its progress for now.Vargas fears that, if passed, the bill could set a precedent that could influence Pennsylvania legislation and threaten Pennâs current status as a sanctuary campus.Calabrese said it is crucial that Penn remains a sanctuary campus in order to protect the students who are not on DACA â in other words, undocumented students who didnât come to the United States as young children, or who fail other requirements of the DACA program.Calabrese said he thinks students protected under DACA are ârelatively safe,â but Vargas is still skeptical.âAlthough it is a source of relief, there is plenty that has to be done,â he said. âItâs not just something that you can sit back on.â\n",

            " Ten same-sex couples, one widow and two children seeking to overturn Pennsylvaniaâs ban on same-sex marriage asked a federal court on Monday to decide their lawsuit against the state before it reaches trial in June.   The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Whitewood v. Wolf, include Law   School    lecturers Fernando Chang-Muy and Len Rieser,    who have been a couple for over 30 years.   The goal of the lawsuit is to legalize same-sex marriage in Pennsylvania and have out-of-state marriages recognized by the Commonwealth, as the plaintiffs argue the current ban violates the U.S. Constitution.   The suit was initially filed on July 9, 2013 by the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, volunteer counsel from the law firm Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller and Penn Law professor Seth Kreimer following the Supreme Courtâs landmark decision in United States v. Windsor, which overturned the Defense of Marriage Act.   Both the plaintiffs and the Commonwealth have agreed that the trial for the case â which was previously scheduled to begin in June â is not necessary, according to an ACLU press release, since the Commonwealth said it would not âcall experts to counter the plaintiffsâ argument.â   âWe have put together a record that answers every question and every objection that every opponent has raised in any court in the United States,â said Mark Aronchick, a 1971 College graduate and attorney representing the plaintiffs.   The ruling in the lawsuit is expected to come any time after May 12, as all remaining documents must be filed by that date.   â[Same-sex marriage] is the most significant civil rights issue in the country today, and this is one of the most important cases advancing that issue,â Aronchick added. âWe are very enthusiastic about the case ... and are looking forward to the day that justice prevails.â   A lawyer for the defendants, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Health Michael Wolf and Secretary of Revenue Dan Meuser, was unavailable for comment as of press time.  \n",

Such schools, which include Penn, have promised to protect their undocumented students by not allowing immigration officials on campus or sharing information about undocumented students with federal agencies unless required by law. In his resignation letter, Pitts wrote that he felt âthe decision to use the term âsanctuary collegeâ politicizes the collegeâ and therefore was not aligned with the Collegeâs decision to deem itself one, according to The Oregonian. Pitts also expressed concern that adopting the label would jeopardize federal funding and place risk on over 40 percent of the students who receive the Pell Grant â a subsidy that the government provides for students who need financial aid.While administrators at schools such as Columbia University, Wesleyan University, Swarthmore University and Penn have declared their campuses sanctuaries, Pitt is not alone in taking a stance against the movement. New Mexico State University President Garrey Carruthers has said that his University âwill not ban federal law enforcement agents from our campus,â and Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber also wrote that âcolleges and universities have no authority to exempt any part of their campuses from the nationâs immigration laws.â \n",

            "The University of California Board of Regents released a statement last Thursday condemning anti-Semitism on its campuses. The statement was released in light of recent anti-Semitic events on UC campuses and the rise in a push for Israel boycotts, primarily in the form of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions or B.D.S. movement. A prior version of the statement included language condemning anti-Zionism but was later amended to prohibit âanti-Semitic forms of anti-Zionismâ when critics pointed out that anti-Zionism is a political belief protected by the First Amendment. The statement has faced criticism from pro-Palestinian UC groups who believe the statementâs intention is to impinge on discussion of Israelâs policies. Some academics fear it will discourage free speech and campus Jewish groups believe it will not do enough to combat anti-Semitism. The Boardâs statement outlines ten main policy points prohibiting discrimination but does not include specific penalties for violations. According to The New York Times, the University of California is the first public university system to adopt such a statement.\n",

            "Harvard will not label itself a sanctuary campus, President Drew G. Faust said at a faculty meeting Tuesday.The meeting was held after students rallied in support of adopting the label, the Crimson reported.Faust said  the term âsanctuary campusâ holds no legal significance, and âcould actually further endanger undocumented students at Harvard,\" according to the Crimson.She added that the designation âoffers no actual protection to our students,â and might instead offer \"false and misleading assurance.âFaust said she has met with Congress members and federal officials to discuss protections for undocumented students.Faust's statement comes just under a week after Penn President Amy Gutmann sent an email to students saying \"Penn is and has always been a 'sanctuary.'\"Princeton also recently announced it would not call itself a sanctuary campus. âThis concept has no basis in law, and that colleges and universities have no authority to exempt any part of their campuses from the nationâs immigration laws,\" President Chris Eisgruber wrote in a statement on November 28. He added that the label would put undocumented students at greater risk by âsuggest[ing] that our campus is beyond the lawâs reach.âPenn is the only Ivy League institution that has deemed itself a sanctuary campus. However, most have issued statements that they would work to ensure the continued implementation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\n",

            "U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) called out Penn on Wednesday, announcing legislation that would punish \"sanctuary\" universities that protect undocumented students.Harrisâ bill would force federally funded institutions, including universities such as Penn and Columbia, to comply with legal demands by government immigration agents, under the threat of a complete cutoff from federal funds, according to The Hill.Penn President Amy Gutmann declared Penn a sanctuary campus for undocumented students in a Nov. 30 email. Federal immigration agents, she said, will not be permitted on campus unless they have proper warrants. Additionally, Gutmann said the University would not give undocumented studentsâ information to the federal government unless lawfully ordered.âShame on those universities who take federal money and then promote lawlessness,â Harris told the Hill, specifically including Penn as an example.\"We fully support all of our students, including our DACA/undocumented students, to the greatest extent possible, consistent with our legal obligations,\" Penn  spokesperson Steve MacCarthy said in an email statement when asked about the bill.\n",

            " Mayor Michael Nutter's budget proposal - which faces criticism from the City's unions - will be scrutinized in City Council public hearings until mid-May. Proposed last week, the budget contains a \"number of difficult choices,\" said Luke Butler, deputy press secretary to the Mayor, but the level of public engagement demonstrated that citizens will support the decisions. However, Bob Bedard, spokesman for the union District Council 47, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said all sources of additional revenue should be explored before services are cut. Otherwise, he said, there will be \"tension between the City and the unions.\" Bedard said District Council 47's members were largely white-collar city workers. He added that until the mayor presents a contract proposal, there is nothing concrete for the unions to respond to and that reacting now is just \"spinning our wheels.\" In a speech last week, Nutter said he asked unions to encourage voluntary furlough days - days off work without pay. Bedard called furlough days \"really just a service cut under another name.\" Nutter's budget also proposes a wage freeze and greater personal contribution to health care for all City employees. \"I'm asking our public employees to contribute more of their salary towards their pensions and health care,\" he said in his speech. But according to Bedard, Nutter has essentially proposed a pay cut. \"If you are taking more out of your pocket but not putting more in, that's a pay cut,\" said Bedard. He added that Nutter \"hasn't done anything\" to find additional revenue, and only appointed a task force on tax policy last Tuesday. District Council 47's President Cathy Scott suggested in a speech in February that the City appoint a \"revenue tsar\" with the power to collect outstanding taxes. Bedard said Nutter \"scoffed at the idea . before embarking on public-relations stunts.\" Bedard also said programs such as Payment in Lieu of Taxes - in which publicly funded, charitable organizations that don't pay taxes give the City some compensation - would generate millions of dollars from institutions such as Penn, but the City has let them \"fall apart.\" Nutter also proposed applying to the Pennsylvania Employee Retirement Commission \"asking that the Philadelphia Pension Fund be declared 'severely distressed.'\" Such status for the fund would allow the City to adopt new plans for future employees, PERC executive director James McAneny said. He said the assessment process involves scoring on a number of financial qualifiers with the total score determining the level of distress. Butler said \"the mayor is fairly confident that the City's fund will be declared severely distressed.\" \n",

            "Penn joined eight other universities on Monday in filing an amicus brief encouraging the National Labor Relations Board not to overturn its 2004 decision. The decision ruled that universities do not need to recognize graduate student labor unions, according to Harvard Magazine.In 2004, the NLRB ruled in a case brought by students at Brown University, along with the United Auto Workers, that graduate students are primarily considered students of their universities, not employees.Students at Columbia University and The New School have both recently brought cases to the NLRB arguing for the right to unionize and receive collective bargaining rights. The NLRB recently invited submission of amicus briefs in the Columbia University case. The amicus brief, filed by all Ivy League institutions except Columbia along with Stanford and MIT, states that collective bargaining has a âburdensome and disruptive effectâ¦on graduate educationâ and intrudes into âlong protected areas of academic freedom.â  \n",

            "10. March 20, 1971 â Villanova 90, Penn 47 The âCats and the Quakersâ second 1971 meeting came in the Elite Eight. The third-ranked Quakers, who had not lost all season, were in for a rude awakening in Raleigh, N.C. The rout was on from the beginning, as Villanova jumped out to a 9-1 lead early and led 43-22 at the break. The âCats refused to slow down after the intermission, scoring the first 16 points of the second half en route to a 90-47 drubbing. Villanova shot a remarkable 61.7 percent from the field while not a single Penn player reached double-digit points. Villanova went on to lose to UCLA in the national championship game. 9. February 10, 1987 â Villanova 71, Penn 60 Penn, led by Perry Bromwell , could not cling to a second half lead and ultimately fell by double digits to Villanova. Penn led by seven at the break, and an authoritative Bromwell steal and slam made the score 43-34 in Pennâs favor early in the second half. The Red and Blue were working with a 46-40 lead with 15 minutes left, but the Wildcats scored the next 10 points to take the lead. The Quakers crept back to get within five with two minutes to go, but the âCats stepped up at the free throw line late to hold the Quakers off and win 71-60. 8. December 2, 2006 â Villanova 99, Penn 89 Despite an outstanding performance from Mark Zoller  and a second half surge from the Quakers, Villanova was able to hold off the Red and Blue at the Palestra. Penn trailed 47-40 at the half and 68-61 midway through the second half before the Quakers went on a run keyed by Zoller and Brian Grandieri , who put the Red and Blue up 72-70 with 9:36 to play. Villanova quickly responded with a Scottie Reynolds  trey, however, and would lead for the remainder of the contest. Zoller led the Quakers with a career-high 33 points. 7. December 11, 1982 â Penn 84, Villanova 80 A lopsided matchup on paper ended up in a shocking upset at the Palestra. 10th-ranked Villanova, which had beaten Penn in its previous seven matchups, could not overcome a Penn offensive barrage that featured career-highs in scoring from Paul Little (23) and Avery Rawlings (16) . Although the game remained close throughout, âNova never led after the middle of the first half. Quakers reserve guard Anthony Arnolie  hit 10 straight free throws in the final 2:29 to seal the deal for the Red and Blue. 6. January 23, 1971 â Penn 78, Villanova 70 The buildup this Palestra showdown saw was significant, as both teams were highly ranked entering the matchup. The Quakers were ranked fourth in the nation with a 14-0 record, while the Wildcats marched in ranked 14th, with a record of 14-3. Big 5 Hall of Famer Bob Morse  got in foul trouble early, and the Quakers trailed at the half. After falling behind 44-36 in the second half, the Red and Blue came roaring back, getting a string of stops and rattling three straight buckets to cut the Villanova lead to 47-46. Morse, who rebounded to score 15 second half points, put the Quakers ahead for good with 13:30 left, preserving the Red and Blueâs undefeated record. 5. February 22, 1995 â Villanova 78, Penn 74 While Penn found the highlight reel, the Red and Blue could not finalize a comeback against No. 9 Villanova at DuPont Pavillion. The Quakers embarked on a 12-4 run after trailing 50-41 at the half. The surge was capped off by an electrifying alley-oop from Matt Maloney to Jerome Allen , which cut the Wildcatsâ lead to one. Villanova led by one again late in the game , when Maloney hit his sixth three to make the score 75-74 in the final minute. After Eric Eberz  of Villanova extended the âCatsâ lead to three, Allenâs last-ditch trey attempt rimmed out, allowing Villanova to escape with the win. 4. January 15, 1969 â Penn 32, Villanova 30 In a historically-low scoring game, Steve Bilsky  proved to be the hero for the Quakers in an upset over the Wildcats. The Red and Blue chose to keep the ball out of the hands of the Villanova offense, and patiently picked apart the Wildcatsâ tight zone defense by holding the ball for a large portion of the game. The crucial sequence came when Penn held the ball for the final 3:35 with the game tied, a possession that culminated in a game-winning Steve Bilsky jumper with three seconds remaining. Bilsky led all scorers with 10 points. 3. December 5, 2001 â Penn 75, Villanova 74 (OT) The Quakers needed a comeback and some extra time to triumph in this Big 5 showdown. After trailing by 10 at the half, Quakers guard Andy Toole â who played with a stress fracture in his right foot â led the Penn rally with 21 points, extending the game to overtime. Toole came up big once again in the extra session, sinking a pair of free throws with 12 seconds left to give Penn a 75-74 lead. The slim advantage would hold, as Penn forward Ugonna Onyekwe  deflected the âCatsâ final shot as time expired. 2. December 6, 1988 â Penn 71, Villanova 70 In front of a packed Palestra, the middling Quakers looked to upstage the No. 17 Wildcats in a classic Big 5 duel. In a back and forth battle that featured a career-high 32 point performance from 7â3â âNova center Tom Greis , the Quakers found a way to come out on top down the stretch. The key play came from Penn forward Jose Tavarez , who converted on a follow in the final minute to give the Quakers a 67-65 lead which they would not surrender. 1. January 9, 2000 â Villanova 67, Penn 65 A sold out Palestra was treated to a tense Big 5 battle that featured big shots and went down to the wire. With 3:55 left in the contest, and Penn trailing 61-51, Michael Jordan  single-handedly mounted an 11-4 Penn run to cut the Wildcatsâ lead to 65-52 with under a minute remaining. Pennâs Matt Langel  then hit a three with 14 seconds left to knot the game up, but âNova had an answer. Malik Allenâs  short baseline jumper that dropped in with 0.8 seconds left gave the Wildcats the edge.

            "Entering Saturday nightâs womenâs basketball showdown between Penn and Yale, the two foes were headed in sharply opposite directions. The Quakers had won seven straight games en route to a first-place spot in the Ivy League, with the Elis mirroring the Red and Blue by losing eight consecutive matchups to fall to sixth.After tonightâs matchup, both teams will be sticking to the status quo.Behind a career-best 25 points from senior guard Kasey Chambers and a first-half team offensive performance for the record books, the Red and Blue cruised to its ninth straight Ancient Eight victory, topping the Bulldogs, 77-59, to remain atop the conference and clinch the programâs third straight 20-win season.âIt was a really awesome performance on both ends of the ball, really terrific. Our energy was great, we hit shots and got penetration,â Penn coach Mike McLaughlin said. âThe passion was really there tonight.âEntering the contest as the lone team unbeaten in Ancient Eight play, the Quakers (20-3, 9-0 Ivy) showed no mercy on the hosts, relying a strong effort from beyond the arc to jump out to a quick 8-0 lead. Stifled by Pennâs 2-3 zone defense â which was ranked 9th in the nation entering the contest by allowing a measly 51.6 points per game â the Bulldogs didnât score for the first 2:37 of the game, finally breaking onto the scoreboard on a mid-range jumper from Nyasha Sarju. Briefly, Yale (11-18, 2-8) began to show signs of life, as three three-pointers from 5-foot-8 junior guard Lena Munzer â who hadnât made a start all season until Saturday and was only averaging 3.3 points per game before the contest â helped the Elis cut the deficit to 15-11, but the shooting and slashing of a pair of Penn guards would soon return Pennâs comfort. Chambers matched Munzer with three downtown jumpers of her own in the first four minutes, as Penn increased its lead back to 21-13 before the first media timeout â with the two teams remarkably combining to score 34 points in the first 3:37 of the contest. Soon afterwards, sophomore guard Beth Brzozowski came off the bench and provided a massive spark for the Quakers, single-handedly scoring seven points in the final 80 seconds of the opening quarter to put Penn put 31-18 after ten minutes. Led by Chambers, the Quakers shot an astonishing 6-for-7 from beyond the arc in the frame, giving the squad its most points in a quarter since womenâs basketball instituted a four-quarter structure at the start of the 2015-16 season.âThe players did a great job knocking down shots, really doing as good of a job hitting threes as weâve done all year,â McLaughlin said. âObviously Kasey Chambers had a huge first half making shots, and then Lauren Whitlatch was also a big performer tonight, so it was just a great team effort.âThe fun was by no means over for the Red and Blue at that point, as the squad continued to nail the hammer on the Bulldogs early in the second frame. Brzozowski and Chambers continued to dominate offensively â combining to outscore the entire Yale squad over the opening 20 minutes â and Pennâs defense proved worthy of its national reputation, besting its first-quarter performance by holding Yale scoreless for the first 5:14 of the second frame and frustrating Bulldogsâ leading scorer Sarju to two points, five below her previous season-low.Spanning the first and second quarters, the Red and Blue went on a 25-7 run to burst out to a 40-18 lead, before more strong shooting from Chambers and Whitlatch boosted Penn to a staggering 54-26 halftime lead. Chambers finished the first half shooting a perfect five-for-five from beyond the arc, leading the team to 10-for-13 three-point shooting and 20-for-28 field goal shooting efforts in the first half, as Pennâs 54 points tied a December 1999 win over Loyola-Chicago for the highest scoring output in one half in school history.âWe wanted to be aggressive â I wanted our guards to attack off the dribble and get penetration, put pressure on Yale,â McLaughlin said, referring to a Bulldogs team that opened the evening in its own 2-3 zone scheme before quickly scrapping it due to the Quakersâ dominance from outside. âWe did a terrific job of moving the ball and getting it into someone elseâs hands â always got the ball to an open player, and we were able to jump ahead quickly.âComing out of the break, Penn got on Yale early for the third consecutive frame, opening with a 6-0 run to stretch the lead to an imposing 34 points before finally beginning to cool off.As Penn didnât make a three-point field goal for the entirety of the third quarter and Yale forward Katie Werner began to establish herself on the offensive glass â finishing with six offensive boards on the night â Yale was able to cut into the lead marginally, but Penn still held a commanding 67-38 advantage entering the final frame.The unexpected offensive performances from Munzer, who finished with a career-best 20 points, and Werner (14 points, nine rebounds) continued in the fourth quarter, but the Elis never realistically threatened, as the deficit stayed above 20 points until the gameâs final minutes. After four players reached double figures â with Michelle Nwokediâs ten points joining Chambers, Brzozowski (15 points) and Whitlatch (13) â Penn finally removed its starters with roughly three minutes remaining, cruising to the 18-point win and keeping the dreams of a perfect season alive.âBoth [Werner and Munzer] did a really good job; the key opened up a little bit for them to push the ball hard and try to get back into it,â McLaughlin said, referencing foul trouble to Nwokedi that kept her out for intermittent portions of the second half. âThey were scoring in transition and making some shots from the outside, but we kept it in control.âNext up, Penn will head to the Empire State, taking on fifth-place Cornell (13-11, 5-5) on Friday before heading to last-place Columbia (12-13, 1-9) for a rare Sunday matchup televised by the American Sports Network. The Red and Blue cruised to comfortable victories against both foes earlier this season, topping the Lions 71-51 and Cornell 65-50 at the Palestra, but with the Quakers remaining a meager game ahead of Princeton (19-4, 8-1) in the conference standings, they know no one can be taken lightly.âI talk to the girls all the time; itâs great to be where weâre at right now, but I talk about it being a process â we have a lot to get done and we have to embrace that challenge,â McLaughlin said. âWe donât talk about the end goal â we talk about getting better day by day and capturing the moment.âItâs fun, itâs why they play, they have a dream to get that [undefeated season] done and I donât want them to back down on that,â he concluded. âIf we keep playing hard like we have, they can continue this journey that theyâre on, and I want them to appreciate it.â\n",

            "With Penn basketball set to face Temple Saturday, we look back at the top 10 greatest Penn-Temple showdowns of all time.   10.  Jan. 8, 1974 â Penn 43, Temple 42  Penn triumphed on the heels of John Beecroft and John Engles in this low-scoring affair. Englesâ two free throws cut the lead to one with less than two minutes remaining. With 25 seconds left, Beecroft sank a 15-footer to give Penn the 43-42 victory in a classic Big 5 Battle. This was the first of several close victories over the Quakers to come throughout the decade. 9.  Jan. 21, 1976 â Penn 55, Temple 52 Although Temple came in on a nine-game losing streak, the Owls gave Penn a run for their money. In a classic Penn comeback, John Engles scored 22 points and Kevin McDonald scored 18 points to give the Quakers a 55-52 victory over the Owls at the Palestra. This was Pennâs fourth-straight victory over Temple in a string of 1970s dominance in the historic rivalry. 8.  Jan. 20, 1971 â Penn 62, Temple 48 Undefeated Penn trailed Temple, 22-19, at halftime. But Dave Wohl, Bob Morse, and current Athletic Director Steve Bilsky led the Quakers on a second-half shooting streak for 11 consecutive points in the final three minutes of the game.  Pennâs 62-48 victory was the first of many more wins over the Owls during the 1970s and early 1980s. 7.  Dec. 8, 2004 â Temple 52, Penn 51 In a back and forth battle, Pennâs Eric Osmundson scored 20 points on the road with six three-pointers, giving Penn a five-point lead with three minutes left. But Temple fought back, and the Owlsâ Marty Collins went to the free throw line with his team down by one after being fouled with four seconds remaining. Collins drained both shots to give Temple a stunning 52-51 victory. 6.  Nov. 28, 1989 â Temple 55, Penn 54 Penn entered the game an underdog to No. 16 Temple, but Big 5 games often go down to the wire. Sharpshooting guard Paul Chambers kept Penn in the game with critical shots, including a bucket with less than two minutes to put Penn within one point of the Owls. Penn had a chance to pull off the upset with a circus shot from forward Vince Curran, but the shot missed wide right, allowing Temple to escape a packed Palestra 55-54. 5.  Feb. 14, 1995 â Temple 59, Penn 56 In front of a sold out Palestra crowd on Valentineâs Day, Penn came up short its effort to break a 13-game losing streak to the Owls. Current Penn coach Jerome Allen and the rest of the Quakers did not score in the final 4:43 of the game, but Penn found itself with the ball down three points in the closing seconds. Penn turned the ball over in a last second scramble to get up a tying try, allowing Temple to escape from the Palestra with 59-56 victory. 4.  Nov. 14, 2011 â Temple 73, Penn 67 (OT) Pennâs Zack Rosen contributing 27 points, six rebounds and six assists, but it still wasnât enough. Temple triumphed over Penn, 73-67 in overtime with the help of senior guard Juan Fernandez and his 19 points. The teams went into halftime tied, and the second half proved to be even tighter as neither team could seem to break away. Fernandezâs stellar overtime play put the Owls over the top for the victory. 3.  Feb. 9, 1983 â Temple 61, Penn 53 (2OT) Penn took a late two-point lead late on a Paul Little bucket, and Temple found itself with the ball with two seconds remaining. The Owls then ran the classic âJack in the Boxâ play and threw a three-quarters court Hail Mary of an inbound pass to Terence Stansbury, who caught the ball, elevated, and drained a 17-foot jumper to send the game to overtime. Temple would go on the defeat the Quakers, 61-53, in double overtime. 2.  Nov. 23, 1998 â Penn 73, Temple 70 (OT) Temple came into the Palestra ranked No. 7 in the nation, but Penn ultimately prevailed over the Owls in overtime, 73-70. The win was Pennâs first over Temple since Feb. 1982. Pennâs Michael Jordan scored 22 points, including the game-clinching free throws in overtime, in a heroic effort resulting in Penn faithful storming the court to celebrate with the team. 1.  Jan. 24, 2007 â Penn 76, Temple 74 Longtime Penn coach Fran Dunphy returned to the Palestra for the first time as coach of the Owls in this memorable game, but he left disappointed as the Quakers rallied from down 19 points on the backs of Ibrahim Jaaber and Mark Zoller, who scored 21 and 19 points, respectively, to defeat the Owls. Despite Temple star Dionte Christmas scoring 34 points, Zoller and the Quakers had the last laugh as Zoller was fouled on a three-pointer with 1.4 seconds remaining. Zoller drained all three from the stripe for a 76-74 victory, followed by Penn fans rushing the court in jubilation.

            "In the world of Philadelphia basketball, 33rd Street has belonged to Drexel since 2006.Following Tuesday evening, by the slimmest of margins, the road will remain Dragon territory.A trio of controversial calls carried Drexel to a late overtime lead, and a potential Antonio Woods game-winning floater with five seconds left fell agonizingly short, as the Dragons (2-8) held off Penn (5-6), 53-52 in the Daskalakis Athletic Center to win their sixth consecutive meeting between the local rivals.âWe needed to get lucky one time,â said Drexel coach Bruiser Flint, whose team has lost six games by single digits this season. âBetter to be lucky than good sometimes.âPenn struck first with a pair of quick layups by Mike Auger and Woods to take a 4-0 lead, before a slew of Quaker turnovers catalyzed an 8-0 Drexel run to put the Dragons up by four.From there, poor offense was the theme throughout the remainder of the first half, with neither team building any momentum for long. Drexel shot a surprisingly poor 26.9 percent from the floor in the first half. Tenacious man defense from Penn limited Drexel to its lowest first-half scoring output of the year, as no one besides guards Tavon Allen and Rashann London (who combined for 15 points in the half) could get anything going for the Dragons.Unfortunately, Penn kept its end of the bargain up, missing its first seven three-point attempts before Woods finally connected from deep to tie the score at 15 after 13 minutes had already passed. Neither team led by more than four at any point in the frame, as a Darnell Foreman assist to Darien Nelson-Henry put the score at 21-20 Drexel after 20 minutes.âI think honestly both teams played really good defense,â Penn coach Steve Donahue said. âDrexel is aggressive and physical and we knew we were going to have to win this game with the set pieces. I was really proud of our guys â we really fought hard, we had chances to win it, just had a couple of bounces not go our way.âAs the second half begun, both teams gave a tease of offensive prowess â Sam Jones scored five points in the first three minutes, while Drexel forward Kazembe Abif, who finished with 13 points and a career-best 14 rebounds, began to dominate inside for the Dragons â as Penn jumped out to a 32-28 lead with 15 minutes to go.However, the offensive struggles soon returned for the Quakers. Over a stretch of more than eight minutes midway through the second half, the team went scoreless and committed six turnovers, as Abif and Allen catalyzed another 8-0 run to seemingly put Drexel in control.âItâs all about our defense,â Abif said. â[Penn] is averaging almost 70 points a game, and we held them to 52.  We talked about getting stops in practice, and thatâs what won us the game; we got stops when we needed to.âLed by Nelson-Henryâs 12 rebounds and three blocks, Penn held defensively, with Drexelâs lead never exceeding four points for the remainder of the contest. A layup by Nelson-Henry, who finished with 10 points, with 2:10 left brought Penn within one point, before a crucial and-one from Auger gave Penn its first lead in more than 10 minutes before Drexel tied it back up.With time winding down in regulation, Woods hit a clutch layup to put Penn up 44-42, but Allen (who finished with 16 points) hit a pair of free throws of his own to tie it back up. Woods missed a jumper just before the buzzer to send the game to overtime, with both teams tying or surpassing their lowest regulation scoring outputs of the season.âAntonio has been great, especially since weâre talking 11 games into his sophomore year,â Donahue said. âHe gets 22 against Temple and then on the road here, gets two really great looks â I thought he got fouled on the first one â and then had a great tuck-under at the end, but just didnât fall. Weâre not getting close to how good Antonio Woods can be, and Iâm excited for what the future holds for him.âSimilarly to the beginning of regulation, overtime began strongly for Penn, with layups by Foreman and Woods giving the team a four-point lead.Like regulation, however, the success was short-lived for the Red and Blue. London scored five straight points to give the Dragons the lead back, before a trio of questionable-at-best calls â one traveling violation on Jamal Lewis, and a pair of shooting fouls on Dan Dwyer and Woods â helped Drexel take a 53-50 lead with half a minute remaining.Penn fought to the bitter end with Woods, who led both teams with 17 points, making a pair of free throws to trim the lead to one before a traveling call on Allen gave Penn the ball back with one possession to win the game again.But Woodsâ second attempt to clinch a Penn victory fell just short, as the seven-foot floater tantalizingly touched nearly every portion of the rim before missing paydirt, as Drexel secured the rebound and cleared the ball to clinch the slim rivalry win.âI thought we really guarded well; canât do anything about officials, they make the calls and you gotta live with them,â Donahue said.  âWe had chances throughout the game, and to go on the road and hold somebody to 29 percent, you hope to come out with the win. Weâre a young team and we have a lot of heart, and we have to put it behind us and get ready for Villanova and league play.â Penn, which still hasnât topped a Division I opponent since a Nov. 25 win over La Salle, will get a few days off to enjoy the holiday vacation before coming back into action with a major test. The Quakers will next face off against national powerhouse Villanova (9-2), the 17th-ranked team in the USA Today Coachesâ Poll, on the road on Dec. 28. Penn has lost to the Wildcats in 12 straight seasons, with the last win coming in December 2002.\n",

            "Penn menâs basketball gave the Palestra crowd (and the members of the Class of '22 in attendance) a game to remember in its 95-90 victory over Brown on Friday night. Although the Quakers did not play their best basketball, they had enough in the tank to improve to 4-0 in Ivy League play ahead of Saturdayâs huge matchup versus Yale. Here are five takeaways from the thriller at the Palestra: The Quakers have the clutch factor late in games While Pennâs first three Ivy League victories were all closely contested games, the Quakersâ will had not been tested to the extent that it was on Friday night at the Palestra. Penn found itself down by six points with about three minutes remaining. Needing a few stops and scores, the Red and Blue dug deep by locking down the Bears defensively and hitting clutch free throws on the other end. Heavily involved in the effort to get back into the game was senior guard Darnell Foreman, who made four free throws down the stretch to ultimately tie the game. This is not the first time that Foreman has been unfazed by the pressure at the line, and at this point, we should expect nothing less from the experienced captain. On the defensive end, sophomore forward AJ Brodeur came up with a big rebound and later a clutch block on Brown forward Tamenang Choh to keep the game knotted up at 82. In the overtime period, defense was once again the calling card for the Quakers, as they held the Bears to just two points in the final minute and a half.  The gutsy finish proved that when the game gets close, Penn trusts in its defense and does not get flustered easily. The question now is whether or not the Quakers can continually pull out these types of late-game performances for the rest of the season. Brownâs Cambridge will be a problem for other teams The fact that Brown guard Desmond Cambridge is a freshman should scare everyone in the Ivy League. Whether or not heâs being guarded, the 6-foot-4 guard from Nashville always has a good chance of putting the ball in the bucket.  With a turnaround jumper that is nearly impossible to block, Cambridge, number 24, showed some flashes of looking a little like an Ivy League version of another number 24, Kobe Bryant. Thatâs not to say that heâs going to be the next Kobe, but the way Cambridge was making difficult shots was awfully impressive.  Case in point: Penn coach Steve Donahue was relatively pleased with his teamâs defensive effort, despite the fact that Cambridge dropped 29 points. âI think Antonio [Woods] is one of the better defenders, if not the best on-ball defender in this league,â Coach Donahue said. âI thought Cambridge surprised him at first and then got it going and then made harder [shots]. I really didnât think we let our guard down too much on that kid.â Perhaps the most impressive part of this scoring performance was the efficiency with which Cambridge shot the ball. Finishing 12-for-19 from the field, Cambridge did not need a whole lot of shots to get his points. The rest of the Ivy League should be on notice because theyâre going to have to deal with this guy for the next four years. Wood and Woods shined offensively In a game that had no shortage of scoring, two players for Penn stood out: junior guard Antonio Woods and senior guard Caleb Wood. Woods dropped 21 points, while Wood bested him by just one, scoring 22. Sometimes the three ball is just falling, and that was certainly the case for these two on Friday night, with each making four shots from distance. One of these three point buckets was especially important for the Quakers. As the first half clock was winding down, Woods pulled up from about 30 feet from the basket and drilled a long range bomb at the buzzer, putting Penn just one point behind Brown at the half. Wood, for his part, came off the bench hot, making the most of his 28 minutes. Along with his excellent three-point shooting, the senior made a couple contested mid-range jumpers, giving the Quakers life whenever they needed it. These performances were particularly important in a game in which sophomore guard Ryan Betley (4-for-10) and Brodeur (3-for-9) did not have their best performances in terms of shooting. Penn prides itself on being a team that can get contributions from any player on any given night, and the team will surely need more performances like this from Woods and Wood to win Ivy games in the future.    The Quakers allowed too many easy buckets Thereâs no doubt that Penn stepped up in a big way on defense late in the game. Without the late-game defensive team effort in the final couple of minutes, the Quakers would not have won the game. With that being said, Brown was able to get too many uncontested layups down low, either from defensive breakdowns or off offensive rebounds.  In total, the Bears notched 11 offensive boards, leading to 12 second chance points. Brown also totaled 16 assists, tied for the most that the Penn has given up in a game all season. This is partly due to the high-powered Brown offense that leads the Ivy League in points per game with 77.1. The Quakers, though, have to do a better job of not letting the opposing offense get too comfortable. Pennâs offense kept Brown on its heels The Red and Blue were quite aggressive driving to the basket, a big reason why they were able to attempt 44 free throws on the night. Oddly enough, that is not the most the Quakers have shot in a game this season; they attempted a grand total of 51 in their quadruple overtime win against Monmouth earlier in the year. Regardless, Penn put Brown in a lot of tough positions on Friday. The Bearsâ game plan to combat the size of Brodeur and Rothschild was to be physical with them. While Brownâs defense did force some turnovers down low, the group was not able to defend without fouling throughout the game. As a result, 64 of Pennâs 95 points came either from inside the paint or at the foul line. While the Quakers will not take this many foul shots in every game, this type of aggressive offensive mindset will continue to pay dividends for them. \n",

            "It took 54 days, a program-record ten-game losing streak and two head coaches, but the menâs basketball team finally earned its first win of the 2009-10 campaign. The teamâs 82-71 victory over University of Maryland, Baltimore County on Jan. 6 capped a tumultuous winter break that began with a coaching change and bottomed out with the programâs worst-ever defeat, a 114-55 nationally televised New Yearâs Eve trouncing at the hands of then-No.7 Duke. The Quakers also dropped contests at Davidson (79-50), Dec. 28 and at Lafayette (77-62) Jan. 3 over the holiday break. âWe needed [the UMBC win] for our confidence,â sophomore co-captain Zack Rosen said. âWe needed it to know we actually are capable of winning.  âWe finally executed a gameplan and ended up with a win,â he added. âI think itâs huge for everyone in the locker room, just believing and knowing that when we go out there thereâs a possibility of us winning every game.â Penn (1-10) used a slow-tempo offensive gameplan to set up good looks from three-point range against the Retrievers (1-13), hitting 13-for-24 from long distance. That was a marked improvement over the previous three games, when the Quakers shot an aggregate 21-74 on three-pointers. Interim head coach Jerome Allen â who replaced Glen Miller Dec. 14 â also implemented a defensive scheme that switched between man-to-man and zone looks. The strategy helped slow UMBCâs pace and limited guard Chauncey Gilliam to just two points in the second half after he had netted 16 in the first. âItâs like dancing. When you have a D.J. playing a song and youâre dancing to one beat, you kinda get used to it and get your rhythm,â Allen said.  âWhat we want to do is stop the needle,â he continued. âTeams play offense to a certain rhythm. I believe that if you can keep them off-balance and disrupt their rhythm, you give yourself a better chance at being successful in terms of getting stops.â That defense was essential, as only two games earlier the Quakers gave up a program-record 114 points to the Blue Devils (14-2, 0-1 Atlantic Coast), one point higher than Penn allowed to North Carolina on March 12, 1987. The 59-point margin of defeat was also the worst in Quakers history, topping the 49-point loss suffered to UCLA on Dec. 14, 1987. The Blue Devils struck early and often, rushing out to a 23-8 lead in the first eight minutes, then widening that lead to 29 points at the end of the first half. Midway through the second half they had expanded their advantage to 40 and never looked back. Five Duke players scored in double digits, led by guard Nolan Smithâs 23 points and forward Kyle Singlerâs 20 points. Eleven different players scored for the Blue Devils, who forced 21 turnovers and out-rebounded the Quakers 43-25. Against Davidson (7-9, 2-2 Southern), Penn struggled to shake off the rust from its 16-day layoff, falling behind early and trailing 46-19 at half. After the break, Penn cut the lead to 19 with just under 14 minutes to go. But the Wildcats went on a 19-4 run that put the contest out of reach. Penn kept it much closer against Lafayette (10-6, 1-0 Patriot), leading after 12 minutes. Though the Leopards keyed a run that put them ahead 39-30 at the break, the Quakers kept it close for most of the second half, even narrowing the margin to seven with 8:40 remaining in the game. Lafayette closed the game with an 18-10 run to earn a 15-point victory. Rosen led the way over the break, totalling 82 points across the four games, including 30 and 28 in the teamâs last two games. He led the team in scoring in every game except against Duke, when junior Jack Egglestonâs netted a team-high 13 points. His contribution was especially important as starters Tyler Bernardini and Andreas Schreiber along with key contributor Larry Loughery are out with âlong-term injuries,â according to Allen. Mike Howlett also missed every game over break, but the extent of his injury was unknown as of the UMBC game. One promising note was the Quakersâ free-throw shooting. The team shot an aggregate 80.3 percent from the charity stripe, an improvement over the 60.3 percent shot over the first seven games. Against Davidson and Duke, Penn only got to the line nine and ten times respectively, but free-throw shooting had a major impact against UMBC as Penn made 21 of 26. With a win finally under their belt, the Red and Blue will look to carry the momentum from the UMBC victory with them into the rest of the season. And with only Big 5 games remaining before the Ivy League slate begins, Penn needs all the positive energy it can muster to try to put together a winning streak.\n",

            "Put the funeral pyres away â Penn menâs basketball is back.Boosted by a ridiculous 27-2 first-half run spearheaded by a career-best shooting performance from freshman shooting guard Ryan Betley, the Quakers jumped out to a 25-point first-half lead at Brown and never looked back, cruising to a 96-72 win over the Bears.âWeâre getting used to playing a little fast and moving the ball, starting to build the confidence and not grinding it on offense; thereâs a sense of âweâre guarding really well,â and then on the offensive end, weâre starting to play like I think we can,â coach Steve Donahue said. âWeâre not there yet, but thatâs a lot more the pace we want to play at and the energy â¦ I think the guys are getting better.âMaybe it wasnât reasonable for the Quakers (10-12, 3-6 Ivy) to fully replicate the unheard of 42-14 first-half score from last Sundayâs win over Cornell, but Betley and his classmates made sure their squad would come as close as possible.Picking up right where he left off during Sundayâs career-high 22-point performance, Betleyâs smooth stroke from beyond the arc helped him score ten of his teamâs first 17 points, bringing Penn out to an early 17-8 lead in the pivotal conference contest.âAfter seeing the first one or two threes go in, it just boosts your confidence,â said Betley, who missed the teamâs first nine games due to a broken hand. âMy teammates kept finding me in open spots, made it real easy for me to keep knocking shots down.âBehind the strong efforts of senior forward Steven Spieth, the Bears (11-14, 2-7) briefly clawed back to tie the score at 25 apiece. But just when it seemed that Brown was ready to make this a ballgame, coach Steve Donahueâs esteemed freshmen class stepped up and calmly put the Bears to bed.With Betley joined on the floor by classmates Devon Goodman and AJ Brodeur, the Class of 2020 wasted no time making its mark in Providence. Spearheaded by Betleyâs absurd jump shooting, Goodmanâs slashing ability and the strong defensive presence in the paint from Brodeur, the Red and Blue absolutely dominated the final seven and a half minutes of the opening half to put the game away early. Overall, the three freshmen combined for 22 of the teamâs points during the aforementioned 27-2 stretch, putting the Ivy League on notice that the Quakersâ young blood is ready to make an impact right now.âYou know, it just shows that as a class, weâre a very good class, and it proves that we deserve to be on the floor,â Betley said. âWe have some ability to score and make things happen.âAfter dropping 23 first-half points including five three-pointers, Betley couldnât quite do the same in the second frame â but fortunately for the Quakers, their lead was gaudy enough to the point where he didnât need to.Though Spieth continued to dominate offensively en route to a team-high 26 points on the evening, the Brown deficit never got smaller than sixteen points.Senior captain Matt Howard used his notorious slashing ability to score nine of his 11 points in the second half, while sophomore guard Jackson Donahue hit a trio of three-pointers in the frame en route to a total of six treys on the night â tying Betley for the gameâs lead â as Penn was able to coast down the stretch to a surprisingly comfortable 24-point win.âWe have so much to prove right now, starting off 0-6 was hard for all of us, and I think we finally figured out how to turn that anger into a competitive, mature nature on the court,â Jackson Donahue said. âPersonally, Iâve been in a bit of a slump lately, and once I saw that first one go down, once they started falling for me, I just got so pumped.âOverall, the Quakers ended up with five players in double figures, led by Betleyâs new career-high of 28 points and Donahueâs 20. The teamâs offensive outburst represented its finest scoring output in more than 11 years, as Penn last broke 96 points against a Division I team in a January 2006 win over Lafayette.Now on a three-game Ivy win streak, the Red and Blue appear to have risen from the dead in the conference tournament race. Combined with Columbiaâs loss to Harvard, the Red and Blue now find themselves a single game out of the top-four spot necessary for entry to the inaugural Ivy League tournament â a situation that appeared impossible when they were left for dead at 0-6 in conference play only days ago.Next up on Sunday, the squad will head to Yale (14-8, 6-3) on Sunday. And though the Quakers have some major momentum as they embark on their unprecedented rags to riches journey, itâs clear that within the Red and Blue locker room, players and coaches know they havenât earned anything yet.âI like that we think weâre still an 0-6 team; that mentality that we donât even deserve to think of playoffs or anything like that until we play what I consider to be Penn basketball,â Steve Donahue said. âWeâre going up there for a fight on Sunday, and thatâs what weâre looking forward to.â\n",

            "Everything about the context of Sundayâs game was the same as Penn womenâs basketballâs contest against Temple back in January: the two teams doing battle, the Palestra serving as host and a Big 5 matchup coming down to the wire.Unfortunately for the Quakers, this time around, the end result was different.Despite yet another double-double from Ivy League Rookie of the Year Michelle Nwokedi, the Red and Blue faltered down the stretch, giving up a backbreaking three to Owlsâ freshman guard Alliya Butts with 3:04 remaining en route to a 61-56 loss in the second round of the Womenâs National Invitational Tournament.âThey know itâs their last game,â coach Mike McLaughlin said. âYou can imagine the feeling that they have and theyâve handled everything well. When [the seniors] reflect back in a couple of hours, they will be proud of everything theyâve accomplished at this school.âThis is a special group of girls and weâll handle it like weâve handled everything thus far: straight on and with their heads held high.âThe game was a rematch of Pennâs 52-50 win over Temple, a victory that clinched the Quakersâ first ever share of the Big 5 title.The beginning of Sundayâs contest was a sluggish offensive affair for both sides. After racing out to an early 5-0 lead, the Quakers (21-9) went over seven minutes without scoring a point while the Owls (18-16) failed to convert their first field goal attempt until the 12:29 mark of the opening period.Nwokedi was on her game from the opening tip. The Missouri City, Texas, native contributed one third of Pennâs points in the first half, notching nine points and pulling down eight rebounds before halftime.The action picked up midway through the first period as Temple turned a five-point deficit into a three-point lead with a quick 8-0 surge in an 84-second span. Five points from Butts keyed that surge, but it didnât take long for the Red and Blue to strike back.Led by six consecutive points by Nwokedi, the Quakers used a 9-0 run of their own to take an 18-12 lead. Later in the half, with the teams knotted at 22 apiece, senior captain Kathleen Roche knocked down a three and converted a layup on consecutive possessions to help Penn enter the break ahead, 27-24.Sophomore center Sydney Stipanovich had 13 points, eight of which came before halftime.Despite the halftime lead, the Red and Blue suffered mightily without senior forward Kara Bonenberger in the lineup. After injuring her knee in the Quakersâ final regular season contest against Princeton, the Walnutport, Pa., native managed to start Pennâs first WNIT matchup against Hofstra on Thursday.However, only a few minutes in, Bonenberger began limping and was forced to exit the game. She did not return to the Quakersâ win over the Pride, and â though she was in uniform â missed the entirety of Sundayâs loss to Temple.Without Bonenberger in the lineup, McLaughlin was forced to start with fellow senior forward Katy Allen, and lacked the teamâs usual depth in the frontcourt.âIt hurt us rotation-wise,â McLaughlin said. âWe had to extend Michelle and Sydney past the minutes they would usually play, and they were fatigued at times. But I thought we managed it well.âMore on the selfish side, I wanted Kara to finish her career on the court. It wouldâve been nice for her to walk off the court having played.âAfter halftime, the squads continued to go back and forth with no team leading by more than three over the course of the first seven minutes. However, a 9-2 run by the Red and Blue gave Penn its largest lead of the day, 41-34.But the lead was gone in a flash. Temple sophomore guard Feyonda Fitzgerald and senior guard Tyonna Williams hit back-to-back threes 33 seconds apart to cut the Owlsâ deficit to one. From there, the teams continued to trade baskets until Buttsâ three.As Temple pushed to punch its ticket to the Sweet 16, Fitzgerald sank a jumper and eight consecutive free throws to seal the deal for the Owls. However, Penn didnât make it easy for its Big 5 rival.After an Anna Ross layup cut Templeâs lead to three with 20 seconds remaining, the Quakers executed a perfect trap of Fitzgerald in the frontcourt. Although it seemed that the Red and Blue stole the ball cleanly, the referees called Roche for a foul, sending Fitzgerald to the line where she sealed the win.âI thought it was a really well-formed trap. It was in a good spot on the floor,â McLaughlin said. âI think the referees maybe anticipated [a foul coming] and blew the whistle, but from my perspective, I thought it was a perfect trap.âI didnât see a whole lot there [for a foul].âWith their season now in the books, the Quakers will prepare for life without Roche, Bonenberger, Allen and fellow senior Renee Busch next season. The Owls will play North Carolina State later this week.\n",

            "COLLEGE PARK, Md. â Penn womenâs basketball went Dancing this weekend, but they only got out on the floor for a single song.A 10-seed in the NCAA Tournament, the Quakers took on seventh-seeded Washington at College Park, Md., Saturday, falling in what was largely a tight contest, 65-53.One of only six players to enter the game for Penn (24-5) prior to the final minute, junior forward Sydney Stipanovich kept the Red and Blue afloat for much of the day with a 16-point, 13-rebound performance. Sophomores Anna Ross and Michelle Nwokedi added 13 and 10 points apiece, but they werenât enough to match up with a Huskies offense that averages 71 points per game.It seemed like it might be a quiet contest at the same arena where the Quakers fell to Texas in the opening round of the 2014 Tournament. Neither team could find the basket until sophomore guard Lauren Whitlatch drained a three to get Penn on the board more than two minutes into the game.Early on, defense reigned supreme. In the opening quarter alone, Stipanovich grabbed eight rebounds while Nwokedi managed to block four shots. That defense also held Washington (23-10) to seven points â the fourth-lowest for the Huskies in a quarter all season. Even still, the Quakers couldnât take complete control of the game.âWe knew they were going to play 40 minutes of game like our kids do,â Washington coach Mike Neighbors said. âWe just wanted to make sure it was at our pace. We kept saying if we could keep it close going into the third quarter, our conditioning would take over.âGoing into the second quarter up 13-7, the Red and Blue appeared ready to take control of the game. But Washington showed why their offense was worth fearing. Talia Walton opened the second frame with a three, kickstarting a 10-0 run that put the Huskies on top for the first time.As was recurrent throughout the game, it was Stipanovich who broke the run, hitting a long jumper off a feed from Ross with seven minutes left in the half. A three from Whitlatch a few possessions later brought the Huskiesâ lead to 19-18. A jumper from none other than Stipanovich tied the game at 20 before the squads settled into trading shots.When Plum made a layup with 2:52 left in the half to go ahead 24-22, the scoring dried up. For 2 minutes and 51 seconds, no one could score.But then Kasey Chambers decided she wanted a third straight game with a buzzer-beater. With a second to go before the break, the junior guard drilled a long three-pointer, sending the Quakers to the locker room with a 25-24 lead.âWe knew we could get [the halftime lead],â Whitlatch said. âWashingtonâs a great team, they have a lot of great players but so do we, and we understood that. The whole time, we believed in ourselves, and I think thatâs all you could ask for.âPlum tied the score at 25 early in the third quarter. The next possession, Chantel Osahor stole the ball from Ross and tossed up a three. It didnât go, but Katie Collier got the offensive board and dished the ball to Alexus Atchley for a layup.In the moment, the sequence didnât seem significant. But it was emblematic of what would eventually doom the Quakers. By the gameâs end, the Red and Blue had committed 17 turnovers and conceded 13 offensive rebounds to the Huskies. Both made it nearly impossible for Penn to maintain any momentum.With 36 seconds remaining in the third quarter, a pair of free throws from Ross gave the Quakers a 40-39 lead. It was the last one they would hold. Walton sank a trey before the end of the quarter, and Washington didnât look back.Chambers hit a three to make it 46-43 with 7:30 to play. Atchley responded with a three. And then another from Walton. And then a jumper from Plum. And then a layup from Collier.For two minutes, a jumper from Stipanovich was the Red and Blueâs only score. When the media timeout finally rolled around, it was 54-43, and the Quakers were noticeably deflated.âEventually fatigue naturally kicks in,â Penn coach Mike McLaughlin said. âBut thereâs no excuses. They wonât make any for themselves either. Iâm sure fatigue became some type of factor, but theyâre used to it.âYet another midrange shot from Stipanovich followed by a basket from Nwokedi and a huge three from Ross helped make it 56-50 with four minutes to play. But the run wouldnât be enough.âWe thought we could get back in it with our own little run, but that didnât happen,â Ross said.A combination of turnovers and missed shots kept Penn behind as time dwindled, before both teams eventually pulled their starters with 37 seconds to go.With that move, Penn coach Mike McLaughlin sent Brooklyn Juday âthe teamâs lone healthy senior â to the court for the final time. Juday was out there as the final buzzer signaled the end of an historic season, and Juday was left to reflect on the end of a career.âIt was bittersweet knowing that it was the very end, but nice knowing that the end was in such a great place to play,â she said.While Juday is looking back on her years at Penn, Whitlatch is looking forward.âThis isnât the end, weâre just getting started.â\n",

            "Call it an overreaction. Say itâs only been two games. But after what we've seen, Penn menâs basketball absolutely has the depth to compete for an Ivy League championship, with or without injured junior guard and last seasonâs leading scorer Ryan Betley. There is no doubt that the loss of Betley hurts. A solid perimeter defender and a lethal shooter from deep, there is not a single guard on the Quakers roster that can do what he does.  But that isnât important because, as a unit, a multitude of guards can step up and fill the void left by the sharpshooter. Defensively, the Red and Blue will not skip a beat. Most of the guards currently in the rotation count defense as a strong suit. Senior guards Antonio Woods, Jake Silpe, and Tyler Hamilton, in addition to starting junior point guard Devon Goodman, have little trouble staying in front of their matchups. Two of the three starting guards for Rice shot under 30 percent from the field.  Silpe in particular was all over the floor, accounting for four first half steals and five total in the Quakersâ 92-76 win over Rice. Woods has always been a defensive stalwart, and the Quakers strongest perimeter defender since returning from his leave of absence last season. Woods, however, appeared to injure his knee late in the second half and did not return. Assuming it is not a serious injury, the backcourt should be fine. Though the Quakers have given up over 70 points in both games this season, more of that can be attributed to the up-and-down pace of both games than to poor defensive mechanics.  The bigger question mark remains on the offensive side of the ball, as all the aforementioned guards are far less proven on that end. Woods was the only returning guard entering the year besides Betley to average more than four points per game last season. However, if the game against Rice is any indication, Penn is capable of picking up Betleyâs slack. Freshman guard Bryce Washington, who took Betleyâs spot in the starting lineup, looked like a completely different player in his first collegiate start compared to his first collegiate game against George Mason. After failing to score in 16 minutes of action on Tuesday, the athletic combo guard looked far more comfortable on the court tonight, shooting 50 percent from three point range to finish with nine points. Washington still has plenty of room to grow, as coach Steve Donahue noted that Washington is still learning on offense. But if he plays like he did against Rice, he can be a reliable option once Ivy League play rolls around in January. Besides Washington, Penn saw great offensive output from Goodman and Silpe. The duo, who battled to be Darnell Foremanâs replacement all off-season, combined to shoot 52 percent from the field, score 26 points, and dish out six assists. Woods continues to be consistent, posting 10 and nine point performances in back to back games this season primarily on drives to the basket. As the team gets acclimated to life without Betley, the guards will get more comfortable in their roles. More of an offensive burden will be placed on them, but with more seasoning, there is no reason to think they wonât respond favorably. Still, even with the solid guard play, this team would be nowhere without the efforts of junior forward AJ Brodeur. In both games this season he has been nothing short of incredible. After putting up 19 points against George Mason, the Massachusetts native poured in 23 points to go along with six rebounds, five assists, and three blocks. After facing a lot of double teams last season, Betley provided some relief for Brodeur down low by being a reliable outside threat. Even with the teams best perimeter threat gone, Brodeur continues to torch opposing defenses.  The Quakers have the compliment of strong guard play and a big man who will surely contend for Ivy League player of the year.  Sure, Rice, a team ranked 298 in the Pomeroy College Basketball Ratings, is far from the strongest opponent Penn will face the season. In fact, it may be one of the weakest. Still, what is undeniable is that the Quakers have an arsenal of guards to compliment the strongest frontcourt its had in recent in the Donahue era. Betley is a big loss, but expectations should still be sky high for Penn as it continues its quest to repeat as Ivy League champs. \n",

            "Two consecutive hip surgeries usually spell the end for an athlete's career. However, walk-on Penn men's lacrosse junior goalie Alex Andersen is not your typical athlete. After injuries forced the premature end of one career, a new one began for him this spring. The origins of his collegiate lacrosse career didn't come on Pennâs campus, however. Rather, they came back at his alma mater, Radnor High School, where he was a two-sport standout in football and lacrosse.  Over Thanksgiving break last fall, his school had an alumni lacrosse game where he played particularly well, especially considering that he had not played organized lacrosse since leading his team to the Pennsylvania state championship his senior year.  âOne of my buddies said, âman, you should totally come out of retirement and play at Penn,ââ Andersen reflected. âI didnât really think much of it.â Andersen was particularly pushed by former teammates Tom Meyers and Jack Wilson, who play lacrosse at the University of Massachusetts and University of Maryland, respectively.  Thus, after realizing his football career was over, the 6-foot-1, 235-pound former offensive lineman decided to reach out to Penn coach Mike Murphy over winter break about walking on.  As Andersen put it: âThe rest is history.â Currently, Andersen is behind starting junior goalie Reed Junkin and talented sophomore backup Alex DeMarco on the depth chart. Still, where he lands on the depth chart was not a factor in his decision to return to lacrosse. âI wanted to be able to come in and push those guys to get better. It really doesnât matter to me exactly where anything with the depth chart lies. That wasnât my focus going in,â Andersen said. âMy focus was that I wanted to come in and make Penn lacrosse better and have fun doing it.â Even with two established goalies, Murphy was pumped when he heard Andersen wanted to return to lacrosse.  âI was really excited. Heâs a great kid and a really good athlete, and we never turn one of those down.â Additionally, it did not take long for Andersen to get acquainted with his new teammates. He already knew a few of them. Growing up, Andersen played for one of the top club lacrosse teams in the country in Mesa Fresh. From his class alone, the club produced 19 Division-I lacrosse players, including current teammates junior defensemen Mike Mulqueen and Noah Lejman. Throughout his high school career, the current backup goalie was arguably more touted as a goalie than as a lineman, given the Ivy leagueâs prowess in lacrosse compared to football. Andersen visited Pennâs campus his sophomore year as a lacrosse recruit. However, the nature of college lacrosse recruiting at the time pushed prospects to commit early, oftentimes by ninth grade. By 10th grade, most of his peers were committed.  When his junior year rolled around, he let the various schools recruiting him know that he was leaning heavily towards playing football in college. âIf an opportunity for lacrosse came up later in my junior year, maybe I would have looked at it then,â Andersen said. âBut having to choose between the two sports that early was a decision I didnât want to have to make.â Despite not being able to suit up for Penn football again, Andersen found ways to stay involved.  After he told football coach Ray Priore that he could no longer play following the 2016 season, the two-time Ivy league champion coach told Andersen he wanted him to stick around as an offensive assistant.  âHe said, âwe still want you here nowâ and really let me be apart of the family even though I wasnât playing,â Andersen said with a smile. \"Heâs just a great guy and I really wanted to thank him for the opportunity to be a part of something special with Penn football.â Andersen could have sulked about how injuries robbed him of the back half his football career or how he is not receiving a lot of playing time this season.  That is not how he is wired.  âI try to bring the juice as much as I can, bring energy to practice everyday, and get better every single day.â Murphy has taken note of Andersenâs enthusiasm and found many ways to utilize the goalie as he shakes off nearly three years away from the game.  âHeâs given us [looks] in practice if we need a bigger goalie or a right-handed goalie based on the scout,\" Murphy said. \"He steps up and does a great job.\" While Murphy thinks it will take a year for Andersen to shake off the rust and get his lacrosse body back, he did not rule out the possibility of Andersen challenging Junkin or DeMarco on the depth chart a year from now. âIf he gets back to 100 percent physically and gets his technique down again, I think he can compete for a starting job,â Murphy said of the former lineman. From injured offensive lineman to walk-on lacrosse goalie, Andersen may be more than just a feel-good story come next spring. \n",

            "Excellent middle blocking is integral to any successful volleyball team. With Susan Stuecheli as captain, the Quakers are already have way there. âThe teamâs looking really good this year,â senior captain Stuecheli noted. âWe have a great dynamic and team chemistry that I donât think weâve ever had before. The whole team is as close as weâve ever been.â Part of Stuecheliâs job as a middle and as a captain is to both literally and figuratively hold the various components of the team together. On the literal side, a middle blocker is tasked with standing at the middle of the court at the net, and blocking the opposing teamâs hitters. They need to be strong, big and consistent in order to help set up the defense. Figuratively, Stuecheliâs captainship calls for her to be the glue that holds this edition of the Quakers together. Leading the team by the example of her consistently strong play, being a positive voice in the locker room and letting her three years of experience guide high intensity situations are all duties Stuecheli will be counted on to help the 2013 Quakers. Head coach Kerry Carr is confident in her middleâs ability. âHaving Susan middle blocking is great because thereâs not much left to teach,â Carr said. âEspecially with our two setters last year being freshmen and them developing, that whole connection is going very well.â Stuecheli realizes that her play will affect both sides of the court. âI see myself bringing another strong year of blocking,â Stuecheli said. âIâm hoping to continue where I left off last year, and build on that. I need to be consistent, which will make the defenseâs job a lot easier.â Carr has already noticed growth in her captain, and not only when it comes to her on-court production. âI think where sheâs grown the most is in her leadership,â Carr remarked. âLast year she was captain, and now that sheâs a senior and a captain again, sheâs in charge of the team and well respected, and thatâs huge.â One way Stuecheli has been able to gain that respect is through the genial personality referenced by Carr earlier, in addition to the trust she places in her teammates. âEvery single middle on this team has a chance to give something to the team in terms of blocking,â Stuecheli said when asked about her fellow middles. âEvery single one is strong and athletic and is capable of being a consistent blocker for this team. I can see us using every middle at some point.â Uplifting her teammates, in addition to setting a standard of productive excellence, is what Stuecheli brings. âShe is someone that is very well liked,â Carr said. âSheâs a peacekeeper of the team. Sometimes being a leader is difficult because she has to go out of her natural personality to tell people what to do or get mad at them but I think sheâs got a really good balance of that.â In terms of team success, perhaps Stuecheliâs most effectual task will be to help develop the second middle blocker. Carr noted that it was an area of weakness last year, and needs some improvement moving forward. âI think coach has many, many options for lineups because everyone on the team is so strong right now,â Stuecheli said. âShe can put middles on the right side, middles in the middle â¦ she can basically do anything she wants and play around with it because everyone is capable of playing multiple positions and doing them well.â Making sure this versatility translates into strong and consistent play at the other middle blocker position bodes well for the Quakers this season and in the teamâs future after Stuecheli graduates.

            "The decision to transfer is one littered with uncertainty, but for two members of Penn menâs lacrosse, their expectations have been far exceeded. A pair of juniors, Tim Sanford and Kyle Gallagher, from Denver and Hofstra, respectively, are nothing short of ecstatic about their decisions to come join the Quakers. Sanford transferred to Penn for his sophomore season for a variety of reasons. âI had a great experience at Denver â the program was very high-caliber and so were the coaches,\" Sanford said. \"But I was kind of struggling with and battling injuries my freshman year there, which prompted me to start looking into other programs that provided better academic opportunities in the case that my injuries persisted.â âI ended up landing at Penn, where the academic opportunities are obviously unmatched. One of the most enticing draws of Penn, though, was the proximity to home. Iâm from New Jersey, and it has been huge for me being back on the East Coast.â For Sanford, the transition has been ideal both socially and academically.   âSocially, it has been different in many ways,\" he said. \"Penn is much more diverse than Denver, which has meant that Iâve had a lot more social and academic opportunities that I mightâve not had otherwise. I felt as if I was able to integrate into the group of guys easily and felt like a had a place here from the start.\" Gallagher, though, is only just beginning to get settled in. He spent his freshman and sophomore seasons at Hofstra and was a crucial competitor for the Pride. His reasons for transferring were a bit more lacrosse-centric than Sanfordâs. âI felt that here at Penn, I had the potential to step into more of a leadership role than I would have had at Hofstra,\" Gallagher said. \"I know that I can make an impact here. As long as I can get the ball, I will be able to contribute to the success that I believe weâre going to have this season.\" Gallagher found that Penn provided a steep learning curve academically, but he has been able to adapt to the change. âAcademically, it is without a doubt more rigorous,\" he said. \"The workload itself is a lot more than what I was used to â not saying that I was able to slack off, but I did have much more free time. But I am not afraid of doing more work. My goal is to graduate with one of the best undergraduate degrees in the country, as well as making a tangible impact on the field along the way.â Despite the challenges of moving to a completely new school, Gallagher feels that the social transition went as he expected. âObviously, transferring anywhere means you are moving into a new group of guys,\" he said. \"Everyone is different, and you arenât familiar with how these new guys work. The first couple weeks are always weird, and I didnât expect to immediately integrate into a group who is so tight-knit. But I met a couple of the guys this past summer, got a great vibe from them, and knew that I could see myself being fully integrated quickly. I feel settled in after a semester here, and the guys on the team are amazing.â On the field, Sanford and Gallagher both have the same goals in mind: winning the Ivy League Championship and advancing deep into the NCAA Tournament. âHonestly, I think we can go as far as anyone else. This team has as much potential as any other top program in the nation, and as long as each one of us can play our role in that, we have a great chance of doing what we want this season,â Gallagher said. Sanfordâs vision corresponded to that of his teammate.  âWe have a very strong team, and as of right now I donât see any major weaknesses,\" he said. \"This season has promise, and I truly believe sky is the limit for us. Our depth and talent is exciting.â The new members of the Red and Blue clearly have high expectations for their program this spring, and the next step to reaching their goals will come on Saturday, as the Quakers take on No. 5 Duke in Durham, N.C.\n",

            "The Quakers have added a new name behind their linebacker unit. Former Widener head coach Dave Wood was announced yesterday as the new linebacker coach. He will fill the position vacated by Cliff Schwenke, who was with the Quakers for the past 11 seasons. Yet Wood brings a wealth of experience of his own. He has 19 years of coaching on his resume and has held the head coaching job at Widener since 2003. His tenure at Widener was highlighted by an undefeated conference record in 2007, which resulted in a Middle Atlantic Conference title and a berth in the NCAA Division III tournament. While Wood will inherit a linebacker unit that returns nearly its entire core, he will not have the help of standout Jake Lewko, who now sets his sights set on the NFL. Nonetheless, Wood is excited about the prospect of coaching for the Quakers. âGrowing up in Philadelphia, it was always obvious that this was a marquee program,â Wood told Penn Athletics. âThey have had so much success on and off the field. When the opportunity to coach at Penn came up, it was a dream come true.â \n",

            "With a kill in the opening set of Penn volleyballâs opening game, Jasmine DeSilvaâs 2014 season was off to a quick start. But the end would come just as quickly.A few points later, DeSilva felt in her knee a sensation that many athletes refer to with dread as âThe Pop.ââI pretty much knew what I had done to it right then,â DeSilva, now one of Penn volleyballâs five senior captains, said.âThe Popâ is perhaps the most telling symptom of an ACL tear, which ended up being only part of DeSilvaâs diagnosis: A torn ACL, MCL and meniscus.âThat was a terrible moment. ... It was really hard to watch that happen and watch her have to go through the whole recovery process,â DeSilvaâs classmate and co-captain Alexis Genske said.âIt was pretty upsetting,â DeSilva admitted.But the Maryland native didnât spend much time feeling sorry for herself. After her surgery, DeSilva travelled with the team, never missing a game or practice. Even if she couldnât step on the court, she couldnât peel herself away from the action, there was too much work to be done.âWhen such a bad injury like that happens, you have to focus on something else. I really picked up my communication with my team, trying to figure out another role I could fill,â DeSilva said.âIf I couldnât help them on the court, then how could I help them off the court? We had freshman outside hitters stuck in that role [replacing me]. And I remember as a freshman, feeling so overwhelmed, and I didnât even have to play every point as a freshman. So I wanted to help them any way I could. I gave them all the advice I could, and that really got me through the recovery.âNow, DeSilva is back, and the people around her can see that a year off the court was most certainly not a year wasted.âWhen Jasmine was out, thatâs when she really stepped forward and became the leader she is today,â coach Kerry Carr said. âIâm not sure that would have happened without the injury.ââShe came in this year a lot hungrier than anybody else on the team,â Genske said. âAfter you sit out for a year, I think you just come in ready to play, and ready to play hard. Especially since weâre seniors, she really feels that thereâs no reason not to leave it all on the court and just go for it. She does a really good job of reminding us of that any time weâre not feeling like ourselves, if weâre coming out quieter or less confident than we should be. She never lacks confidence.ââYou see the court so much better when youâre off the court,â DeSilva said. âI learned so much sitting back and watching. Iâm a way more consistent player now, I hit smarter shots, I feel like I know what to do if weâre out of system â all these little skills I didnât have before, I have now.ââSheâs such a smart player out there,â Carr echoed. âShe doesnât make the same mistakes she made in [previous] years. And physically, sheâs just as good a player that left the court. In fact, I think sheâs stronger, because she really got the chance to hit the weight room and lift more than she had been.âTo take something that could have been terrible and ended her career and make it into something that pushes her career even higher, itâs amazing.ââI was most worried about coming back and not being the same player,â DeSilva said.âBut Iâm actually glad Iâm not that same player.â\n",

            "Two months after Katie Schumacher-Cawley shocked the team by leaving Penn after just one year for Penn State, Penn Athletics announced Monday that a new head coach had been hired for Penn volleyball: Iain Braddak. Schumacher-Cawley left the team in February after only one year. She was named head coach following the departure of Kerry Carr, who had coached the team for 19 years, in February 2016. As the third head coach for the Quakers in as many years, Braddak will take over the program during a critical time with the team losing six seniors to graduation, including All-Ivy setter Sydney Morton.  This isnât a team that has been lacking in leadership for the last two months, though. In the offseason, assistant coach Josh Wielebnicki and members of the team helped to lead workouts and tide the team over until a new head coach was hired. Now that Braddak has been hired, he will look to replicate the success that heâs enjoyed at other institutions. After graduating Springfield College in 2010, he started his coaching career as an assistant coach at his alma mater. Working there for two years, he earned a Master of Science in sports performance and advanced level coaching while helping the team to a NCAA Division III Elite Eight run. Heâs since been a head coach three times at the D-III level, working at Culver-Stockton College, the US Merchant Marine Academy, and at Smith College. He had success at all three, creating a brand new menâs volleyball program for Culver-Stockton and leading the USMMA womenâs volleyball team to its first back-to-back winning seasons in a decade. Braddak gained D-I and Ivy League experience during a brief stint with Columbia last year. He served as an assistant coach for the Lions, who went 5-9 in conference last season. Heâll be moving up by becoming a Quaker, as Penn went 7-7 in the Ancient Eight last season, and will look to use his experience at the rival institution to help the Red and Blue further improve.\n",

            "Without a doubt, Penn menâs lacrosseâs Connor Keating is one of the sportâs brightest stars. Not just in Philadelphia. Not just in the Ivy League. Period.   Operating for the last three seasons as a long stick midfielder, Keating has been deservedly shrouded with honors. Heâs been an All-American. Heâs been All-Ivy. Earlier in March, he was even named to the official 50-player Watch List of the Tewaaraton Award, annually given to the best player in college lacrosse.  He really is that good, even if nobody saw it coming.   When Penn coach Mike Murphy first saw Keating play as a high schooler, he was a more traditional short stick midfielder buried on the depth chart of The Haverford School, one of the best high school lacrosse programs in the country.  In Keatingâs own words, he didnât really have an identity as a lacrosse player at the time. âI wasnât really that good to be honest. I was on JV actually until my junior year. I didnât even make the varsity until I switched to long pole.â  Still, even as a self-described âaverage short stickâ stuck on the junior varsity, Keating demonstrated enough potential to capture coach Murphyâs eye, even if Murphy and his staff werenât fully sold on his abilities.  In fact, the main reason that the Penn coaching staff kept tabs on Keating at all was the fact that coach Murphy had a good relationship with the Keating family.  âTo be honest, I really wanted to recruit him, knowing that he was a good athlete and a good kid from a good family,â Murphy said. âThe problem was that he just never quite did enough offensively to warrant us recruiting him, and so I said to his brother and to his high school coach that I thought that he could become a pretty good long stick [midfielder]. I obviously didnât know that heâd become what he has become, but I figured it was worth a try.â   On the advisement of both the Penn coaches and his coaches at The Haverford School, Keating embraced the position change.  âAt the time, I was open to any suggestions,â Keating said. âI trusted that [coach Murphy and his staff] knew what they were talking about it. Theyâve seen more lacrosse than anyone. Iâm glad that coach Murphy suggested it too because itâs been great for me.â   A few weeks after advocating for the position change, Murphy watched Keating play as a long stick midfielder for the first time at a tournament in Baltimore. While his positional play still lacked polish, Keating performed well enough to earn an invitation to one of Penn menâs lacrosseâs recruiting clinics in the fall.  It was at this clinic where the fate of a future All-Americanâs career hung in the balance. And even after the position switch, the path to convincing the Penn coaching staff that he was worthy of a roster spot wasn't a smooth one. âAt the clinic, I was really impressed by his growth, but he was a little rough. Technically, he didnât really know how to play defense yet,\" Murphy said. \"Not everyone was sold. Some of our coaching staff didnât think that he was very good, and in some ways, they were right.\" Fortunately for the entire Penn menâs lacrosse program, the staff took a risk and offered an unpolished, still-developing long stick midfielder a spot on the team.  And, as the old adage goes, the rest is history.   In the subsequent years, Keating would hone his craft and earn a starting spot on Pennâs team as a freshman, a far cry from his days as a high school sophomore unable to make Haverfordâs varsity team. With 29 goals, 38 points, 165 ground balls, and 25 caused turnovers, Keating has established himself as arguably the best two-way player in the nation.   âHeâs the best long stick middie in the country now,â Murphy said. âBut at the time we were recruiting him, none of us could have seen it coming.â  That being said, with his college senior season about to begin, it was time for Keating to make one more switch. This time, less for his individual benefit and more for the sake of his team.  With the graduation of 2017 starters Kevin Gayhardt, Kevin McDonough, and Eric Persky, the 2018 Quakers had some serious holes to fill at close defense, and so, the staff turned to the teamâs best player for help.   âI knew that the team might need some help at that spot,â Keating said. âThe switch from long stick midfielder to close defenseman was something that the coaches approached me about. They felt that it was what the team needed, and Iâm always willing to do whatever the team needs to succeed.â   And so, as a senior All-American, Keating has made yet another successful position change, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by his coaches.  âTo make the switch, as the high-caliber player that he is, that just tells you the kind of kid he is,â Murphy said. âHeâs really selfless and committed to us. Heâll do whatever we need him to do to help us win.â   According to Keating, the selflessness and commitment that he shows are simply reflective of the support of his coaches and teammates.   âThese coaches are awesome,â Keating said. âThey work with me all the time, and theyâve taught me really quickly, so that I can keep getting better at it.â  Even more praise was heaped upon his teammates, as it was obvious from Keatingâs energy and voice how thankful he is for the work that they have put in to help him become the player that he is â first as a long stick midfielder and now, as a close defenseman.   âMy teammates have helped with the transition tremendously,â Keating said. âI try to learn as much as I can from every player. Each guy on the team has a distinct skill set that I can learn from.â  Specifically, Keating attributes most of his success to Pennâs scout team, the group of players that rarely sees action during games but practices every day against the starting defense, mimicking the formations and characteristics of Pennâs next opponent.   âThe guys that have been most helpful to me as far as learning the new position have really been the scout guys,â Keating said. âGuys like Kyle Scheetz, Drew Robshaw, and Nolan Munafo come out here at practice everyday and play attack and dodge against me everyday. These guys donât often get recognized in terms of accolades or even playing time, but they work as hard as any of us. I have been beyond fortunate to play with and against all of those guys this year.\" In this, his final season, you can bet that Keating will savor each and every one of his relationships with his teammates and coaches, all of whom have helped him and all of whom he has helped right back.\n",

            "After nearly three months, Penn volleyball completed its first head coaching search in nearly 20 years when Athletic Director Grace Calhoun announced the hiring of Katie Schumacher-Cawley on Friday.Schumacher-Cawley graduated in 2002 from Penn State, where she was a two-time All-American and won an NCAA Championship as a player. She then coached as an assistant for six years with the University of Illinois-Chicago before landing the head coaching role at UIC before the 2009 season.At UIC, Schumacher-Cawley oversaw 113 wins as head coach, third in program history, and led the Flames to the 2012 Horizon League championship. Her career record as head coach stands at 113-135, with a 52-70 mark in Horizon League play.Schumacher-Cawley stepped down as the UIC head coach on Thursday to take the job at Penn.âI am excited to welcome Katie to the Penn Athletics family,â Calhoun said in a statement. âHer head coaching experience and successful playing career make her the right fit to lead our program. Katie will foster a competitive, hard-working, family-oriented culture on the court while recognizing the academic and athletic balance of our Ivy League student-athletes.ââMy family and I are so excited to begin a new chapter of our lives at Penn,â Schumacher-Cawley said in a statement. âI am thrilled to join a program that has such a rich tradition and has the best and brightest student-athletes that you will find anywhere in the world. I want to thank Dr. Calhoun, Scott Ward, and all those who share my vision for what we can achieve together. It is a tremendous time to be a Quaker, and I truly look forward to working with everyone connected to Penn Athletics as we strive to achieve new heights in the classroom and Ivy League championships on the court.âSchumacher-Cawley will have the tall task of replacing former Penn coach Kerry Carr, who stepped down after nearly two full decades in December as the winningest coach in program history. But the new coachâs new charges are excited by her impressive resume as a player:âOh yeah, absolutely. It gets us really pumped up, having someone who has been through all that,â junior captain Kendall Covington said. âShe knows what itâs like, and she knows what it takes to get there, and having that knowledge will push us a lot more than we have been pushed in the past, because she knows what will make or break it.âThe team is also excited by Schumacher-Cawleyâs relatively young age for a head coach.âVolleyball is an evolving sport, itâs a very different sport than it was 10 years ago, let alone 30 years ago,â junior captain Sydney Morton said. âBut she has been playing and watching it evolve for a long time, and Iâm excited that she is young because she knows the trends of the volleyball world right now, because sheâll teach us the newest styles and the newest ways to do things, and thatâs super exciting for me and the rest of the team.âThe hiring of a new coach answers what had been the lone major question mark for Penn, as the Red and Blue will return every player from last seasonâs squad in 2017.\n",

            "As the defending Ivy League champion, the Penn volleyball team enters the 2010 season faced with the loss of six seniors to graduation, including 2009 Ivy League Player of the Year, Elizabeth Semmens. But head coach Kerry Carr announced yesterday that the team will be boosted by five members of the Class of 2014 with impressive credentials: Kristen Etterbeek, Taylor Permenter, Kristin Schoonover, Dani Shepherd and Susan Stuecheli. âThis group of women joins our young, but hard-working group of returners, and will immediately address the loss of our large senior class,â Carr told Penn Athletics. âBecause of this highly talented foundation, we should be able to hit the ground running in September.â Carrâs returning players include first team All-Ivy selections Megan Tryon, Madison Wojciechowski and Lauren Martin, as well as second team All-Ivy Julia Swanson.  Tryon and Wojciechowski will have familiar company next season. Incoming freshman libero Dani Shepherd attended the same high school as both juniors, winning three Sunshine League Championships during her time there. Shepherd is hardly the only champion among the incoming volleyball Class of 2014. A member of three regional championship teams in high school, outside hitter Kristin Etterbeek also won three regional championships in tennis and received All-Michigan tennis honors in 2008 and 2009.\n",

            "For the fourth year in a row, the price of a Penn education will increase by 3.9 percent for the upcoming school year, the University announced Thursday. Total undergraduate charges â including tuition, room and board and other fees â will be $58,812 for 2013-14. Tuition alone will increase from $39,088 this year to $40,594 next year. The hike was approved by the executive committee of the Board of Trustees.  Although the University has now kept tuition increases below 4 percent for the past five years, it is likely that 2013-14 will mark the last year in which some families will see a bill below the $60,000 mark. If total undergraduate charges increase at the same 3.9 percent rate next year, it will cost $61,105 to attend the University in 2014-15. As in previous years, Pennâs administration cited rising operating costs as the primary reason for the tuition hike. âIf weâre going to maintain the same size student body and our costs continue to go up, we have to keep raising revenue,â Executive Vice President Craig Carnaroli said. âWe never stop looking for ways to keep cost down, but thereâs always going to be upward pressure on things like tuition.â While Pennâs single-year tuition changes may appear small, the Universityâs increases in cost have added up substantially over time. The total cost of attending Penn has increased 18 percent over the past five years, and 48 percent over the past decade. In 2004-05, a Penn education was nearly $20,000 less than what families pay today. Pennâs total charges of $58,812 make the University the second most expensive Ivy League institution â behind only Dartmouth College â that has announced tuition increases for 2013-14.  Cornell, Columbia and Harvard universities have not yet announced total costs for the next academic year. On Thursday, the University also said it will be increasing its financial aid budget for 2013-14 to $188 million, marking a 5 percent increase over projected aid expenditures this year. âThrough our innovative no-loan program, we are sending a strong and positive message to present and future Penn students: this institution will continue to recruit and enroll the finest students, and no student will need to decline the opportunity to experience a Penn education for financial reasons,â Penn President Amy Gutmann said in a statement. This yearâs rate of increase for the financial aid budget is slightly less than the past two years, when funds allocated to undergraduate aid rose by 7.7 percent.  Since Gutmann took office in 2004, Pennâs aid budget has increased by an average rate of 9.1 percent per year. Carnaroli said that the lower rate of increase this year was not a âconscious decision,â but rather a reflection of what the University projected it would need to allocate in 2013-14 to maintain the same aid program that saw 46 percent of undergraduates receive need-based grants this year. Thursdayâs tuition announcement has troubled â although not necessarily surprised â some across campus. âIt is very hard to see any rational policy basis underneath it at all besides, âLetâs get more and more money, letâs spend more and more money and if we have a problem in future, weâll deal with it in the future,ââ said Graduate School of Education professor Joni Finney, who researches higher education finance. âCosts keep rising, and at some point even an extremely wealthy institution like Penn is going to have to come out and say that enough is enough.â College junior Mehak Chadha, an international student from India, agreed that the increase is concerning. âI think itâs quite a bit, especially because Iâve talked to friends at other colleges and we just seem to be paying a lot more here at Penn,â said Chadha, who is not on financial aid. Finney added that, as tuition continues to rise and the average value of Pell Grants remains stagnant, the impact of government aid on studentsâ ability to pay for college lessens. Carnaroli said that the University takes changes in federal aid into account when determining studentsâ financial needs. âWeâre not insensitive to the families that pay the full amount, but we do have to put all of this in the context that we are need blind, so weâre essentially meeting the full need of students through the criteria weâve established,â he said. While Finney praised the Universityâs aid program as one of the best in the nation, she cautioned that annual tuition increases at a school like Penn can have a much wider âripple effectâ throughout higher education. âPenn exists in a larger higher education environment, and when Penn and other well-to-do institutions increase their tuitions like this from a high base, it gives license for others to go down the same route,â she said. âThatâs not the message that we want to send.â\n",

            "With increased calls to examine the level of economic diversity on campus, Pennâs efforts to recruit students from across the income spectrum have been brought into question. Last semester, an opinion column published in the Penn Almanac by English professor Peter Conn criticized the University for the job it has done in bringing low-income students to campus. Connâs letter prompted a University-wide panel in November that focused on the role economic diversity plays at Penn. While Penn President Amy Gutmann acknowledged that low-income representation is important at Penn, she feels that âthe middle class often gets left out the discussionâ about economic diversity. âWhen financial aid began, there was this huge focus on low-income students â¦ but thereâs no reason to put an artificial line in the sand between low- and middle-income families,â she said. Director of Financial Aid Bill Schilling said while Penn has no official definition for âmiddle income,â it can range from lower-middle-class families that make $40,000 a year to upper-middle-income families that earn more than $200,000 a year. According to Gutmann, factors like this yearâs record-high number of applicants from California, as well as the total number of students who applied for financial aid in the early decision round, show that Pennâs financial aid policies are not limited to lower-income students. âWe made a big move in going all-grant, no-loan and being able to communicate that to all families,â she said. âWeâre among a small number of institutions who have done that.â âI think [financial aid at Penn] compares very favorably with virtually all except those colleges with extremely large endowments,â Schilling added. âI would say that we certainly are on par with all but a handful of peer colleges.â For College freshman Lizette Garcia, financial aid proved to be the key factor in her college decision. Upon receiving a significantly better financial aid package from Cornell University â which expected her to contribute $13,000 a year, rather than $58,000 at Penn â she asked Student Financial Services to review her situation. When Garcia received an improved package in which she would only have to pay $16,000, she chose Penn. However, she added that she âknows [that] a lot of people probably have never heard of bringing in [another schoolâs] financial aid package and doing what I did.â âI feel like the majority of students here are either going to have enough money to pay the full tuition, or they have such low income that Penn is paying everything for them,â she added. âComing from a middle-class family, I feel like my college decision was completely based on financial aid.â Schilling explained that while SFS does not have a formal policy of matching aid packages from peer institutions, it tries to âreduce the difference between our package and the other schoolâs package so the student can make the decision about where to go based on factors other than price.â Top Colleges educational consultant Steven Goodman â who received his masterâs degree from the Graduate School of Education in 1989 â feels that there is âa lot more work that needs to be doneâ to reach out to middle-income college applicants. âIt really comes down to the use of resources in the admissions office,â he said, adding that recruiters should be making more of an effort to target high schools with prospective students who are more likely to be aid eligible. Schilling acknowledged that Pennâs recruitment process focuses more on lower-income students because they may be first-generation college applicants who âdonât have as much information and understanding of financial aid and how it can reduce the sticker price.â Meanwhile, students from middle-income and upper-middle-income families are more likely to be in the applicant pool in the first place, Schilling said. Once applicants are admitted, however, SFS is committed to providing financial aid across the income spectrum in order to âput them in a position to accept their offer,â he added.

            "The millions of college applications that students fill out every year translate to a hefty source of revenue for colleges and universities.  An application fee is a required part of a studentâs application for many undergraduate schools, but the price varies across institutions. For Pennâs undergraduate application process, applicants must pay $75, which is in the lower 50 percent among application fees for Ivy League universities. Taking application fee waivers into consideration, Penn made approximately $1,817,730 from application fees during this past 2017 admissions cycle.  Columbia Universityâs fee â $85 per student â is the highest in the Ivy League, while Princetonâs $65 rate is the lowest. Despite the little variance in students' individual application payments among the Ivy League schools, the total revenue earned by these institutions from application fees varies by millions of dollars. According to Penn Dean of Admissions Eric Furda, the $75 price tag is not the result of a precise calculation. Rather, it is based on a consideration of the range of the application free prices among Penn's peer institutions. \"We looked at what our ivy cohort looks like, our Ivy plus group,\" Furda said. \"We make sure we are not on the high end of it â we are comfortably in the middle of the pack.\"  Despite allegations that the fees are arbitrary costs simply meant to generate revenue, universities substantiate the need for the large revenue by pointing to large admissions staff and expensive technologies that are needed to process the increasing number of college applicants. Furda said that the revenue earned by application fees funds a portion of the total cost of the Office of Admissions' operations. \"Those dollars help pay for our outreach, our recruitment, our fly-in programs,\" Furda said. \"So, it does help defray the actual cost of our operations.\" Nonetheless, most colleges including Penn offer the option of an application fee waiver for applicants who are unable to pay for them. The Common Application, the website which functions as the baseline application for over 700 colleges around the world, offers a simple application fee waiver for students who qualify for at least one of over eight indicators of financial need. According to Furda, between 35 and 40 percent of applicants to Penn receive application fee waivers every year.  For many high school students, the price tags on college applications are significant factors into their decisions about where to apply. \"A first gen student here communicated this â that if you just add it up: to take your tests a couple of times, to apply to X number of schools, financial aid applications, the CSS Profile. You add all that up, and Iâm doing this somewhat off the top of my head, it could add up to $2,500 to $4,000 to apply to college,\" Furda said. When applying to colleges, College freshman Vraj Shroff was initially worried that he would not be able to apply to colleges simply because of their application fees. However, after speaking with his guidance counselor, he found out about the Common Application fee waiver request and soon applied to Penn through its early decision process. âApplying to college is really expensive â sending AP scores, SAT scores, ACT scores,â Shroff, who is also a Social Media and Web staffer at The Daily Pennsylvanian, said. âI wouldnât have been able to apply to Penn without the fee waiver.â      \n",

            "Penn admitted 3,404 out of 42,205 applicants for the Class of 2024. At 8.07%, this year's acceptance rate is slightly higher than last year's, marking the first acceptance rate increase in five years. The Class of 2024 is an exception to the steadily declining acceptance rates over the past few years, with 7.44% of applicants admitted for the Class of 2023, 8.39% admitted for the Class of 2022, and 9.15% admitted for the Class of 2021. Penn received 42,205 total applications for the Class of 2024, a 6.1% decrease from the University's largest applicant pool in history of 44,960 applications in 2019.  Decemberâs early decision results also broke nearly a decade of declining ED acceptance rates in Pennâs admission history, admitting 19.7% of applications. The University received 6,453 ED applications for the Class of 2024, a 9.2% decline from the 7,109 applicants in the previous year.  In 2018, the ED acceptance rate was the lowest acceptance rate in history at 18%, dropping from the 18.5% acceptance rate in 2017.  According to Dean of Admissions Eric Furdaâs blog, 15% of admitted students in the incoming class, approximately 500 individuals, identify as first-generation college students.  For some admitted students, Penn has been a part of their families for generations. Thirteen percent of students in the admitted class are legacy students with a parent or grandparent who has attended Penn.   In the Class of 2024, 53% of admitted students are United States Citizens or Permanent Residents who self-identify as a member of a minority group. Fifty-one percent self-identified as students of color in the year prior. Both this year and last year, 53% of the admitted students are female.  Twenty percent of the accepted class are estimated to qualify for a Federal Pell Grant, which provides need-based grants to low-income undergraduate students. Last year, the percentage of Pell Grant eligible students was not released in Furda's original blog post.   âAccess and inclusion for talented students of all backgrounds continues to be one of the highest priorities of Pennâs President, Dr. Amy Gutmann,\" Furda wrote in his blog post. \"To have one in every five admitted students come from a Pell Grant-qualifying background is a testament to her leadership, particularly regarding Pennâs grant-based financial aid policies.\" Admitted students of the class hail from over 2,000 different high schools and all 50 states, as well as Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The states with the most representation in the incoming class include Pennsylvania, California, New York, New Jersey, Florida, and Texas. One hundred sixty-eight students are from the city of Philadelphia. International students represent 14% of admitted students who come from 98 countries ranging from Albania to Zimbabwe. Percentages of accepted female, first-generation, legacy, and international students remain unchanged from the Class of 2023 rates. Each year, the University admits approximately half of the incoming class through the Early Decision Program. Penn plans to enroll a class of 2,400 after having already admitted 1,269 students through ED.

            "Penn isnât alone among Ivy League schools that have seen a decrease in the total number of applications received this year. Following Pennâs 1.7-percent drop in overall applications for the Class of 2016, Harvard, Princeton, Brown and Columbia universities have announced decreases of 1.9, 1.9, 7 and 8.9 percent, respectively. This followed a record-breaking application cycle for all four schools with 15, 3.3, 3 and 32-percent increases in applications to the Class of 2015, respectively. Last year, Pennâs 31,663 total applications received marked an all-time high. Dean of Admissions Eric Furda linked the slowing of the applicant pool growth to changes within the high-school population. âThere are shifting demographics â there are fewer high-school graduates,â he said. âYouâre seeing geographic shifts within the United States.â Lucie Lapovsky, principal of the higher education firm Lapovsky Consulting, agreed that the changing demographics of high-school students may have played a role in the decrease of applications to Penn and its peer institutions. âThe number of students coming from highly educated families is falling,â she said. âThe number of students who would be first-generation college students is increasing and theyâre less likely to apply to a significant number of colleges.â Harvard Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William Fitzsimmons attributed the decrease to a number of factors, including the return of early action programs at Harvard, Princeton and the University of Virginia. He said  this may have kept some students from applying to more colleges in the regular decision round. According to The New York Timesâ âThe Choiceâ blog, four of the five universities that reported the largest applicant pool increases to date are public institutions. Ramapo College of New Jersey had a 30-percent increase in applications, and the University of California, Los Angeles, University of Virginia and University of California, Berkeley reported 18, 17.6 and 16.5-percent increases, respectively. Lapovsky said as sticker prices of private universities are increasing, more students may be applying to public schools. âThe value of spending more than $200,000 for four years of college in these uncertain economic times is being questioned,â she said. Michael Goran, a 1976 College graduate and founder of IvySelect College Consulting, agreed that students may not be aware of financial-aid policies at schools like Penn, causing them to turn away from private colleges. He said the increasing selectivity of Ivy League universities may have contributed to the decrease in the applicant pool, as well. âIt may have to do with the perception that the Ivies are more and more difficult to get into,â he said. âThe admission rates are falling and so theyâre adding schools [to their list] where they wouldnât have before.â Alan Hwang â who is applying regular decision to Penn from Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, Calif. â also observed a decrease in private-school applications around him. âMost people at Monta Vista are just applying to the UCs,â he said. âI think if private collegesâ prices werenât so high and if the Ivy Leagues werenât so selective, more people at Monta Vista would apply.â While many of Pennâs peers experienced dips in their applicant pools, a few Ivy League schools saw their numbers continue to rise. Cornell and Yale universities, as well as Dartmouth College, reported slight increases of 3.5, 5 and 3 percent, respectively. Overall, Fitzsimmons sees a potential positive effect from this yearâs general application trends across the Ivies. âWe may experience a period of greater stability and less frenzy in college admissions â a welcome result for everyone,â he said.

            "At 5 p.m. today, Penn will accept 9.8 percent of regular decision applicants, the Office of Admissions announced Wednesday afternoon. Pennâs overall acceptance rate of 12.3 percent for the Class of 2016 is the exact same as the initial acceptance rate last year. After accepting students off the waitlist throughout the summer, the Class of 2015âs final overall acceptance rate was 12.4 percent. The University admitted a total of 3,846 students to the Class of 2016, including 97 out of the 886 students who were initially deferred in the early decision round. This yearâs target class size will be 2,420, Dean of Admissions Eric Furda said. Furda said he was pleased with Pennâs numbers, especially given the return of early action programs at Harvard and Princeton universities, which may have contributed to the Universityâs 1.4-percent applicant pool drop. Penn received 31,216 applications overall this year. Though Penn âlost about 800 applicationsâ to Harvard and Princeton because of the schoolsâ early programs, he said the quality of the admitted class has not faltered. He pointed to the average SAT score of 2185 among this yearâs class â a four-point increase from last year â as evidence of this. âThe quality is still there,â he said. âThereâs always a difference between quality and quantity, and thereâs a balance between the two.â President of Hernandez College Consulting Michele Hernandez said the consistency of the numbers year to year is a âgood sign of a well-formed admitted class.â Though Penn has seen significant decreases in its acceptance rates over the past two years, this yearâs trend should not be a cause for concern, she said. âA couple of years ago, Pennâs overall admit rate was over 20 percent,â Hernandez said. âI think theyâre where they want to be.â Michael Goran, a 1976 College graduate and founder of IvySelect College Consulting, agreed. âI donât think the admit rate is bad news at all,â he said. âPenn still had over 31,000 applicants and the applicant pool is undoubtably just as strong. I donât think the trend always has to be upward.â Furda believes that this yearâs pool of admitted students reflects the Universityâs revamped outreach efforts to new locations and demographics throughout the country. About 14 percent of the admitted class came from southern states, a geographic region that the Office of Admissions has been targeting in its recruitment over the last four years. âItâs where demographic growth is in the country and thatâs a big factor for us,â Furda said. This also marked the first year that the Office of Admissions used the Common Application to track first-generation college students, instead of having admissions officers manually count the number of these applicants. This year, 14 percent of the admitted students are students whose parents have not attained college degrees. Furda said this new utilization of the Common App will help the Office of Admissions assess the starting point from which it can continue to increase its outreach. Though Furda was pleased with Pennâs numbers, news of Pennâs acceptance rate did little to help alleviate the anxiety that many regular decision applicants are feeling with less than 24 hours until they learn of their admissions decision. Decisions will be available online to students at 5 p.m. today. Isabella Gong â who applied regular decision from Freedom High School in Orlando, Fla. â said the fact that the acceptance rate remained steady was âslightly comforting but not a lot, because itâs still pretty low.â Rocio Gonzalez â a regular decision applicant from Thomas Alva Edison High School in Puerto Rico â said she is still nervous despite the relatively stable numbers. âItâs still really nerve-wracking because thousands of people applied, and sometimes I think itâs just luck,â she said. âIâm just crossing my fingers.â\n",

            " Pennâs all-grant, no loan-policy is unique to the University, but how does its undergraduate student aid rank among some of the other Ivies?   On Friday afternoon, President Amy Gutmann announced a new initiative Â­- effective immediately - that aims to raise $240 million for undergraduate financial aid.   As undergraduate costs rise in the upcoming academic year, the University estimates that the average grant for eligible students will increase to $41,700 for the 2014-2015 school year.   This academic year, the total financial aid budget was $188 million and the average grant per student was $40,200.   The DP takes a look at financial aid around the Ivy League.   Princeton University   At Princeton, where the 2013-2014 total cost of attendance for undergrads was $53,250, the average freshman received $41,450 in grants.   The average grant covers the entire cost of tuition, according to Princetonâs Undergraduate Admissions. For expected family contributions, Princeton does not take into account the value of a familyâs home when considering their assets.   Princeton is one of six colleges that offer need-blind admission and full-need financial aid to international students.   The other five schools are Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Amherst College, Yale University and Dartmouth College.   Princeton offers its own financial aid application and does not require students to fill out or pay the fee for the CSS Profile.   While Princetonâs tuition has increased by 58 percent since 2000, its financial aid program has increased by 115 percent.   Cornell University   Cornellâs Award Match Initiative   commits to matching the family contribution and financial aid offers from other Ivy League schools as well as Stanford, Duke and MIT. Additionally, its Loan Initiative   offers need-based loans that are capped based on family income.   The total cost of attendance for a non-New York state resident in 2013-2014 was $61,618.   Dartmouth College   At Dartmouth, once a demonstrated financial need has been determined, the first source of aid comes from student self-help which consists of student loans and on-campus employment. As of summer 2012, Dartmouth eliminated loans from financial aid packages of students with family incomes of less than $100,000.   Grants and scholarships are awarded to those who still have a remaining financial need and students eligible for Federal Pell Grants   are prioritized.   Outside scholarships can be used to reduce the self-help   level of financial aid packages.    Dartmouthâs cost of attendance for the incoming Class of 2017 was $63,659.   Yale University   For the 2013-2014 academic year, while cost of attendance was $60,900, the average Yale Scholarship was $41,250. The University provided a total of $119 million in need-based financial aid this academic year.

            "After receiving a record-breaking number of early-decision applications this fall, Penn admitted 24 percent of its early-decision applicant pool, a drop of 1.3 percentage points from last year's 25.3 percent acceptance rate.The Office of Admissions welcomed 1,316 early-decision applicants to the Class of 2019 on Monday via online admissions decisions, which became available to the record-high 5,489 applicants at 5 p.m.This year's early-decision round saw a 6.6 percent growth in applications following last year's record 5,149 early-decision applicants.\"The students who apply ED to Penn are remarkable in so many ways,\" Dean of Admissions Eric Furda said in a statement. \"The admitted class reflects Penn's commitment to create a dynamic learning community for all of our students.\"The accepted applicants comprise 54.4 percent of the target class of 2,420 students across all four undergraduate schools. The Office of Admissions also selected 54 percent of the entire class in the Early Decision round last admissions cycle.Admitted students hail from 45 states and 46 countries, with roughly 40 percent identifying themselves as students of color, according to a press release from the Office of Admissions. 124 students are the first to attend college in their family â a 29 percent increase from last year.Many were accepted through partnership programs as well. Penn matched with 45 students through QuestBridge College Match, a national program that helps increase undergraduate enrollment of high-achieving, low-income students at selective universities, and seven students became acquainted with Penn through the Knowledge Is Power Program, a nationwide network of free open-enrollment college-preparatory schools in underrepresented communities.The Office of Admissions cited to Penn's all-grant, no-loan financial aid policy and continued recruitment efforts as contributing factors to the increase in Early Decision applicant pool.âWith over 10,000 undergraduates, Penn is the largest school in the country to offer this type of innovative aid program,\" University Director of Financial Aid Joel Carstens said in a statement. \"Pennâs aid program sends this strong messages to families: achieving a quality education does not require student debt.âAcross other peer institutions, Harvardâs Early Action admission rate dropped from 21.3 percent to 16.5 percent. Dartmouth yielded 26 percent, dropping from 38.8 percent last year. Brown Universityâs acceptance rate increased by 1.1 percent to 20 percent. Both Dartmouth and Brown have Early Decision policy like Penn, wherein students, if accepted, are bound to attend the school. Stanford University also accepted 10.2 percent of its early applicant pool, a slight decrease from the year before.Among Ivy League universities, Yale, Princeton, Columbia and Cornell universities have yet to release acceptance statistics.âMy colleagues and I see firsthand the enthusiasm and thoughtfulness these students bring to the college search process, and we take their commitment to this institution very seriously,â Furda said. âTheir potential for future impact is tremendous, and we are excited to see them make Penn their own next fall.âThe regular decision application will be open until January 1, 2015.Correction: A previous version of this article stated that there were 4,589 applicants this round of early decision, and that the applicant pool dropped by 1.3 percent. There were 5,489 applicants, and the applicant pool dropped by 1.3 percentage points. The DP regrets the error.\n",

            " The families of Penn students seem to be financially stable relative to this year's unpredictable economy. Midyear undergraduate requests for additional financial aid increased to about 90 cases this academic year compared to 60 last year, but that difference is not the \"sharp rise\" the University had been expecting, according to Student Financial Aid director Bill Schilling. He speculated similar situations at peer institutions. SFS has just begun processing applications for next year and will not be able to gauge the full impact until May. However, said Schilling, \"Just in my gut from the bad news we've been hearing in the media, we are anticipating a significant level of growth in the number of students requiring aid and the amount requested.\" He added that SFS will review aid eligibility anytime a student's circumstances change, even midsemester. While Penn has pulled back in faculty hiring and salaries, University President Amy Gutmann has reaffirmed the school's commitment to maintain need-blind admission for students and to implement the no-loan aid package initiative that will be fully effective this fall for all aid-eligible students, regardless of family income or class year. So far this fiscal year, SFS has distributed a total of $131.5 million of aid to 3,838 students, $116 million of which is grant aid and of that, $102 million comes from Penn funds, according to Schilling.  The average package size was $34,269 - a slight increase of 2 percent over last year - and consisted of $30,142 in grants, $1,449 in loans and $2,678 in work-study. Money for financial aid comes primarily from Penn's operating budget, as well as from the endowment and the employee benefits pool. About 19 percent of the endowment is set aside for aid, and its spending rate for aid increased from 4.7 to 6.5 percent this year to carry out the no-loans aid policy. According to a December survey by the Chronicle of Higher Education, 83 percent of private colleges reported lower-than-usual tuition increases for next year. Penn recently announced a tuition increase of 3.8 percent for next year, its lowest increase in 41 years. The increase in tuition and the endowment spending rate for aid will allow Penn to raise the budget for financial aid by $17.6 million - 15 percent - for the next academic year to implement its no-loans aid policy. Penn's budget office is still identifying where funding for the increased budget and potential increased aid requests next year will come from, according to Schilling.  He added that if Penn's projected expenditures continue to worsen, one solution will be tapping into unspent reserve funds for aid. Schilling also anticipated some of the increased need from students to be offset by the increase in Pell grants from the stimulus package. \"It's even more critical right now to have as robust of an aid program as we can,\" said Schilling.\n",

            "With Penn's recent announcement of a 3.8 percent increase in the cost of attendance for the next academic year, other elite universities have also seen similar spikes in their costs of attendance. Pennâs Board of Trustees voted on March 2 to increase the total cost of attendance from $68,000 to $71,200 for the 2018-2019 academic year. Former Vice President of Budget Bonnie Gibson previously told The Daily Pennsylvanian in an email that Penn âdoes not consult with our Ivy League peers about tuition,â but other Ivy League universities and peer institutions will also see similar price boosts for the next academic year, all within a three to four percent increase. Harvard University, Yale University, Princeton University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, and Brown University have all recently announced a rise in their undergraduate costs of attendance for the upcoming school year. Columbia University has yet to announce its cost of attendance for the next academic year.  Harvard announced that the total undergraduate cost of attendance for Harvard College will increase by three percent next year, from $65,609 to $67,580. The increase, however, is significantly lower than Harvardâs 4.1 percent increase in total costs last year. Out of all of the Ivy League institutions who have announced their changes in cost of attendance, Harvard also has the lowest tuition rate of $46,340. At Yale, the cost of attendance will increase by 3.8 percent, from $66,900 to $69,430, for the next academic year, according to a university announcement on March 16. Tuition will also rise from $51,400 to $53,430. Out of the seven institutions, Princeton will see the largest shift with a 4.6 percent increase. Its cost of attendance increases with undergraduate tuition rising from $47,140 to $49,330 and its total cost of attendance expected to be $70,010, according to the university's website. Cornell announced plans to increase undergraduate tuition by 3.75 percent for the third consecutive year in a row. Tuition will rise from $52,612 to $54,584 for undergraduate students, with the exception of New York state residents who are enrolled in the contract colleges. These students will experience a tuition increase from $35,242 to $36,564. At Dartmouth, cost of attendance will increase by 3.9 percent for the next academic year, with a tuition increase from $51,468 to $53,496, according to a university statement released on March 4.  Similarly, Brown will see a 4 percent increase in undergraduate tuition. Brown administrators voted to increase the cost of tuition to $54,320 on Feb. 11. The Ivy League universities are not alone in their cost increases. Other elite schools, including Stanford University, recently announced tuition hikes for the upcoming school year.  Stanford's Board of Trustees approved a tuition increase within the 3 percent to 4 percent margin. The Stanford Daily reported that undergraduate tuition will experience a 3.5 percent increase in the 2018-2019 year, with a tuition increase from $48,987 to $50,703. Although Pennâs tuition cost will escalate, the budget for financial aid will also increase. Penn will spend an extra 5.25 percent on financial aid, meaning there will be a total of $237 million allocated to studentsâ financial aid for the next school year. Universities like Brown and Cornell will also see a similar rise in financial aid funds.     \n",

            " Penn baseballâs thrilling run isnât over yet.   With the Gehrig Division title on the line, the Red and Blue split their four game series with Columbia to remain tied atop the standings and force a deciding one-game playoff next weekend.   After getting shut down 6-0 in the series opener, the Quakers (24-16, 15-5 Ivy) bounced back by taking the middle pair of games by scores of 12-4 and 3-2 before falling in the finale, 5-2.   âItâs a great series,â Penn coach John Yurkow said. âNobody wants to give in, and thatâs why weâre going to a game five.â   Game one was all Columbia (24-17, 15-5), as the Lions used a dominant pitching performance by senior lefty David Speer to grab their 15th straight victory.   The Lions were able to jump on Penn starter Connor Cuff and take advantage of several Penn miscues early to score five runs in the first three innings of the opener.   Columbia pushed a run across in each of the first two frames, then broke it open in the third with three runs to make the contest 5-0.   Speer, who went the distance with seven strikeouts for his second straight shutout, limited Penn to only three hits in the first six innings and helf the Quakers in check throughout.   A crucial game two pitted a pair of undefeated righties in Pennâs Jake Cousins and Columbiaâs George Thanopoulos against each other on the mound.   Despite getting into tough situations early on, Cousins surrendered only one run in the first two innings.   In the bottom of the second, the Red and Blue found themselves with runners on second and third after a hit batter, a single and a balk.   Sophomore infielder Mike Vilardo then drove in junior first baseman Jeff McGarry to tie the game with his team leading 18th RBI in conference play before   Matt McKinnon plated    sophomore outfielder Matt Greskoff with a single.   But the Lions would charge right back.   An error from sophomore Ryan Mincher gave Columbia runners at first and second, which set the stage for a deep drive to right field by first baseman Nick Maguire.   The Penn miscues continued, as    Matt Greskoff dropped the towering ball just short of the fence, allowing two Columbia runs to score.   The Lions threatened to take the lead on a single to right, but Greskoff bounced back by gunning down Maguire at the plate.   The Quakers quickly regained a 4-3 lead in the bottom of the third when Matt McKinnon drove in Vilardo with a RBI single.   But the big blow came from Greskoff, who more than redeemed his earlier miscue with a bases-clearing double that just made it over Jordan Serenaâs head in centerfield.   Up 7-3, McKinnon kept the runs coming in the fourth with an RBI single that scored two and extended Pennâs lead to 9-3.   Freshman Mitchell Hammonds entered the game for Cousins in the fifth and gave up a run in his first inning of work before settling in and ultimately grabbing the win with five innings of relief.   The Penn bats refused to quiet down, however, as a bases-loaded double from McGarry in the bottom of the fifth gave the Red and Blue three more runs of insurance, effectively sealing the game.   âWe came out with our backs up against the wall and responded really well,â Yurkow said of his teamâs game two performance.   Game three proved to be the most dramatic contest of the series, with Penn holding off a seventh inning charge by the Lions to secure a 3-2 win and go ahead in the series two games to one.   The Red and Blue took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when third baseman Mitch Montaldo doubled off sophomore Kevin Roy to score Ryan Mincher.   With lefty Ronnie Glenn throwing another gem for the Quakers, Pennâs offense quieted down until the late innings.   In the sixth, Greskoff roped his second RBI double of the weekend to push the Penn lead to two and junior catcher Austin Bossart followed an inning later with a RBI single.   Looking for his first complete game of the season, Glenn gave up four singles and two runs before forcing a game-sealing groundout with the tying run on third base.   In the seriesâ final game, the Quakersâ bats fell quiet after giving Penn a 1-0 first-inning lead.   Penn junior pitcher Dan Gautieri gave up a run in the second and two more in the fourth before he was pulled and replaced by Cody Thompson, to whom he handed a 3-1 deficit.   Columbia responded quickly to the change, adding two more runs in the fifth to make the score 5-1.   The Red and Blue got a run back in the seventh on a grounder by Vilardo, but would score no more.   The two teams will now play a one-game playoff in the next week, with the starters presumably the same as Fridayâs game one â Speer vs. Cuff. The game will be played at Pennâs Meiklejohn Stadium, but a date and time are to be determined.  \n",

            "Penn baseball knew it would be in for its greatest test of the season this weekend against an evenly matched opponent in Columbia.The Quakers took the field on Saturday tied for first place in the Ivy Leagueâs Lou Gehrig Division,  hoping to clinch the title by winning at least three out of the four games. Instead, the Red and Blue split the series with the Lions â Penn won the first game of doubleheaders on both Saturday and Sunday, while Columbia took the nightcap each day.âWe always know itâs going to be a dogfight with us and Columbia, especially these past two years,â senior catcher Austin Bossart said. âWeâre going in excited all the time.âThe series began at Columbiaâs Satow Stadium in New York. Bossart staked the Quakers (22-14, 16-4 Ivy) to an early lead, hitting a solo home run in the first inning. Senior pitcher Ronnie Glenn surrendered that lead in the third, however, when Columbia strung together a series of singles to take a 2-1 lead.But Penn answered back in the fifth, scoring two runs on the back of a triple by junior outfielder Matt Greskoff and a double by senior shortstop Mitch Montaldo, before making it 4-2 in the sixth.In the seventh, Glenn allowed a solo home run to Lions third baseman David Vandercook, but that was all he would give up as the burly right-hander finished off the final three batters for his fifth complete-game victory of the year.âHeâs been awesome,â coach John Yurkow said of Glennâs durability.Sophomore pitcher Mike Reitcheck â starting Saturdayâs second game â delivered an even better performance, pitching eight innings while allowing only one run. However, that run was all Columbia (25-14, 16-4) needed. Despite garnering 10 hits â including five doubles â Penn could not get a run across the plate, leaving nine men on base en route to a 1-0 loss.âI think there was a little over-trying,â Yurkow said of the teamâs failure to score. âA little pressing. Guys were trying to do too much with runners in scoring position. We did hit some balls hard, and [Columbia] made some plays. Itâs crazy how you had these two high-scoring teams, and [Saturdayâs] games were so low scoring.âGood pitching beats good hitting any day of the week.âBack at Meiklejohn Stadium on Sunday, Penn celebrated its 10 graduating seniors before taking the field for the dayâs first game.Sophomore pitcher Jake Cousins got to work immediately against the Lions, tallying five strikeouts in the first four innings. Cousins garnered six total punch-outs in seven innings, while allowing only one hit. Montaldo provided the big blow for the Quakers in their 2-0 victory with a solo home run in the bottom of the fourth inning.âMitch has been huge,â Yurkow said. âItâs nice to know that if we need a couple runs, he can pop one out and get a rally going pretty quick.âThe streak of great performances by the Red and Blue pitchers came to an end in Sundayâs second game, as senior Connor Cuff was unable to make it out of the first inning. Cuff began the game inauspiciously by hitting Columbiaâs leadoff batter with a pitch. He would go on to allow a single, a sacrifice fly, another hit batsman and then a two-run double before he was removed from the game.âYou could tell pretty early on that his command wasnât there,â Yurkow said of Cuff. âHe was a little erratic. He just didnât have it.âWe had the bullpen rested, and I think if you have that opportunity, you just have to use all of your guys.âYurkow went to his bullpen early, which he has not often been forced to do in a season where his starting pitchers have tossed ten complete games.âItâs been a while,â Yurkow said. âLucky for us, Ronnie and Mike went deep into games on Saturday. That gave us the chance to hang in there and compete today.âDown in an early 3-0 hole, the Quakers did not go quietly and answered with a run in the second. The game proved to be a tug-of-war between the two teams, as Penn tied it up with runs in the third in a bizarre sequence of events that included a catcherâs interference, a hit batsman and walk â the latter two of which came with the bases loaded â to force in two runs.Penn took the lead in the fourth inning on a Bossart home run before ceding it again in the fifth inning. The score was tied at six by the seventh inning, which was how it remained through the ninth to force extra innings.Columbia notched two runs in the top of the tenth inning and, despite a late two-out rally in which the Quakers got runners to second and third, they could not come up with a big hit, and fell 8-6.âIf we got a hit here or there in the seventh or eighth, it could have been a different outcome,â Yurkow said. âThere were some mixed emotions. We felt like we could have won the series, but they were well-played games. There werenât too many errors and the pitchers threw strikes. It was very good college baseball.âNow, the Quakers will play a one-game playoff next week to decide the Gehrig Division.âWe wouldâve liked to have won the series, but we still have a shot,â Yurkow said. âI like our chances going up there for next weekend. Weâll be well-rested, and weâll see what happens.â\n",

            "It involved a lot of late-inning action, but Penn baseball walked away with the weekend split against Dartmouth and Harvard, losing the first game in each of the back-to-back doubleheaders before taking the second.It appeared as though the weekendâs inaugural tilt would be a rough one for the Red and Blue (13-14, 5-3 Ivy).Sophomore right-hander Billy Lescher gave up a one-out triple to Dartmouthâs Kyle Holbrook, followed quickly by a pair of singles â the first of which scored Holbrook.With the Big Green (9-17, 2-3) threatening to break the game open, however, Lescher settled down, retiring the next two batters and allowing only three more hits the rest of the game.Down a run, sophomore Daniel Halevy led things off for Penn in the second. After watching the first pitch go by for a ball, the sophomore got a hold of the 1-0 pitch, launching the ball over the left field fence to tie things up.Heading into the bottom of the seventh in a 1-1 tie, Lescher gave up a leadoff single to senior Nick Ruppert, who moved to second on a sacrifice bunt. When the next batter, catcher Adam Gauthier, walked, Ruppert deftly stole third, putting the winning run just 90 feet from home.Lescher intentionally walked Feinstein to load the bases with one out, trying to create a force out at home.He wouldnât be able to get it, as Holbrookâs pop-up to second was just deep enough for Ruppert to score, securing the 2-1 victory despite Lescherâs strong performance.âEvery time out, I think heâs been a little bit better,â Penn coach John Yurkow said of his budding ace. âTo be honest, he pitched good enough to win that game.âPenn showed off its short memory that afternoon â when play resumed the Quakersâ offensive struggles were all in the past.Mincherâs three-run blast in the first put the Quakers up early, and they never looked back.âWe had a couple nice two-out hits from Sean Phelan and Daniel Halevy,â Mincher said. âAnd I was just trying to put a nice swing on the ball and trying to find the barrel and trying to score a run.âLed by 3-for-4 performances from Mincher and junior catcher Tim Graul â who scored three runs apiece â the Red and Blue exploded for 11 runs on 14 hits, including three homers. Junior southpaw Gabe Kleiman gave up just four hits over six scoreless innings as senior Mitch Holtz ceded Dartmouthâs sole run on an RBI groundout in the seventh in the 11-1 rout.Momentum in hand, Penn headed down to Cambridge, ready to take on a Harvard squad just 1-5 in conference play. Once again, however, an early lead proved insufficient for the Quakers.After an RBI single from Tesch in the second and a run-scoring ground out for OâNeill in the third, junior lefty Mike Reitcheck seemed to have the game well in hand for the Red and Blue.Through four innings, the Crystal Lake, Ill., native had given up one hit while throwing a scoreless game, but the Crimson (9-17, 2-6) finally got to him in the fifth. With runners on first and second and two out, Ben Skinner got a hold of an RBI single to right, getting Harvard on the board.An error by freshman Matt Tola the next batter allowed Skinner and Connor Quinn to score a pair of unearned runs and give the Crimson a 3-2 lead.Penn managed to get a man on in the sixth and seventh, but could do nothing with it, falling by that single run in the dayâs first contest.Game two brought more pain for the Red and Blue. Although RBI singles from Tesch and Mincher gave the Quakers a 2-0 lead in the third, Harvard scored three in the fourth off of junior Adam Bleday.An RBI double from Mincher in the fifth handed the lead back to Penn, 4-3, but once again, the Crimson mustered a response. With junior Jake Cousins working in relief for the Quakers, Harvard loaded up the bases with no one out.A fielderâs choice forced an out at home before Cousins walked in a run. Skinner then hit a sacrifice fly to Tesch in center, giving the lead back to the hosts, 5-4, before Cousins forced a fly out to Matt Greskoff in right.It seemed like it was all over for the Quakers with two out and a runner on third in the ninth.Down to their final strike, Mincher tied the game back up for the Quakers, launching a double to the wall in left to score OâNeill and make it 5-5.With the Crimson unable to score in the ninth, the game dragged through a scoreless 10th before freshman Chris Rabasco hit home Grant Guillory in the 11th with an RBI single for his first career hit to give Penn the 6-5 lead.âWe had a nice performance from Bleday and we handed it over to Cousins and he gave us a chance to win the game,â Mincher said. âThatâs all you can ask for.âHarvard managed to get a man on in the 11th, but couldnât tie it up, as Penn finally won the marathon game and secured the weekend split. Yurkow put the significance of the win bluntly.âWell, I can tell you this, the bus ride home is a lot better than it would have been if we would have lost that game.â\n",

            "It was a big-time stage for a big-time game â but by the slimmest of possible margins, Penn baseball couldnât get the big-time win itâd been seeking for decades.Despite leading almost wire-to-wire in the championship game of the Liberty Bell Classic, one timely swing of the bat from La Salleâs Ben Faso proved to be the difference, as his eighth-inning dinger accounted for both the Explorersâ runs in a 2-1 victory that prevented the Quakers from winning their first championship in the local tournamentâs 26-year history.As such, the Red and Blue remain the only Division I program to have ever competed in the Liberty Bell Classic not to have won it yet, forcing the Quakers to wait until next year once again.âAbsolutely, itâs a tough loss,â freshman pitcher Mitchell Holcomb said. âBut you come back, and you go for a good win on the weekend, and you hope that the guys turn it around quick.âThe loss was certainly no fault of Holcomb, who stepped in as the starting pitcher after each of Pennâs four regular starters were burned in last weekendâs sweep of Princeton and performed even better than he couldâve imagined.After a career-best effort in the tournamentâs semifinal against Villanova â an 11-2 Penn win in which the rookie threw a career-high seven innings with only six hits and one run allowed â Holcomb was even more dominant under the bright lights of Citizens Bank Park on Tuesday night.Though he did get into a bit of trouble in the second inning, getting into a bases-loaded, one-out jam before retiring the next two batters, the freshmanâs overall line for the night included four hits allowed, two walks and nine strikeouts in seven innings of shutout ball in what was unquestionably the finest effort of his young career.âI got a great group of guys around me, they support me really well,â Holcomb said. âYou know, my faith is a big one, and you just have to make sure to keep your head in the game the whole time youâre in there, fighting for every out.âThe Red and Blue (18-15, 8-4 Ivy) came out firing in the top of the first on Tuesday, with Tim Graul doubling and being knocked in by a Matt OâNeill sacrifice fly.It was only one run â but for nearly the entire night, it looked like all the Quakers would need.With just about every type of pitch working, Holcomb ran through the Explorersâ lineup inning after inning, keeping the Red and Blue afloat as La Salle (7-27, 1-8 Atlantic 10) ace and fellow freshman Matt Holt had his very own impressive effort in a thrilling pitchersâ duel of rookies.âYou know I really wanted to help the team; they put up one in the first and I really wanted to do it for the ballclub,â Holcomb said. âChampionship games, you do the best you can to give your team a chance to win. We put the ball in play a lot and nothing fell for us today; thatâs baseball.âHolcomb seemed to be only getting stronger as the game went on, striking out a combined five batters in the sixth and seventh innings without allowing a hit in either frame.But with the rookie never having exceeded seven innings in his college career, coach John Yurkow made the call to the bullpen to bring in middle reliever and fellow freshman Christian Scafidi to start the eighth.The decision, though justifiable at the time, would come to bite the Red and Blue.Facing the heart of the La Salle order, Scafidi walked Kevin MacGowan, putting the tying run on. Immediately after, Faso provided his late-game heroics with a huge drive over the left-center field fence, emotionally crushing the Red and Blue as one-run lead turned into a one-run deficit in the blink of an eye.âYou know, if they asked me to do another one, I wouldâve gone,â Holcomb said. âBut I was glad to give somebody else a chance.âThough Tommy Pellis reached with an infield single in the top of the ninth, that would be all Penn could muster, as La Salle closer Austin Constantini sent the Quakers home empty-handed to give the Explorers their first Liberty Bell Classic title since 2006.As frustrating as the loss is for the Red and Blue, it goes without saying that thereâs a different championship out for the taking that serves as a bigger concern for them. And after sweeping Princeton to move to first place in the Ivy League Lou Gehrig Division, the team still is in fantastic shape to win the Ancient Eight title for the first time since 1995.Next up in that quest, Penn will travel to Cornell in a four-game set that should prove pivotal for both teamâs title hopes. After finishing in last place in the Gehrig Division in 2016 and being almost universally predicted to do the same this season, the second-place Big Red (17-12, 6-6) have served as a solid surprise story, led by power-hitting first baseman Cole Rutherford and his league-leading seven home runs.So while Penn is understandably disappointed at Tuesdayâs loss, thereâs solace in this â another championship is ripe for the taking, and the Red and Blue will get a second chance to make history.\n",

            "Penn baseball had a wild first weekend of Ivy League play.The Quakers split a doubleheader against Dartmouth on Sunday, winning 4-3 on Sunday before falling to the Big Green by the same score in the dayâs second game. The Red and Blue (7-9, 3-1 Ivy) then walked off twice against Harvard to sweep Mondayâs twin bill.âLetâs put it this way: If I had hair, Iâd be pulling it out,â the bald coach John Yurkow said while laughing about the weekendâs many nailbiters. One run decided each of the four games.Pennâs ace, senior pitcher Connor Cuff, went the distance in the first game against Dartmouth (4-16, 2-2), pitching seven innings while giving up three runs and striking out six. It was not vintage Cuff, but it was enough to keep the Quakers  close.A home run by junior right fielder Jonah Campbell and RBIs by junior designated hitter Matt Greskoff and senior left fielder Connor Betbeze brought the game to the bottom of the seventh inning tied 3-3. After Campbell singled and later advanced to second base, junior center fielder Gary Tesch stepped to the plate.âI was just trying to get myself in a good count to hit, get a good pitch to hit,â said Tesch of his strategy in the at-bat. âI was looking for a fastball.â Tesch singled, and an awkward bounce caught the Dartmouth right fielder by surprise as he fumbled the ball, allowing Campbell to score to give Penn the walk-off victory.â[The pitcher] gave me a good pitch to hit, I put it in play, and it had a fortunate bounce,â Tesch said.The second game would not bounce Pennâs way, however. After RBIs by senior catcher Austin Bossart and senior first baseman Matt McKinnon staked Penn out to a 2-0 lead, the bullpen squandered a scoreless seven innings by sophomore pitcher Mike Reitcheck, as two relievers combined to give up four runs in the eighth and ninth innings.Penn would get its momentum back, however, in their first game against the Crimson (10-12, 0-4) on Monday with a fantastic start by senior pitcher Ronnie Glenn. After giving up a run in the first inning, Glenn proceeded to reel off eight scoreless innings, striking out five along the way to save the bullpen in what would become an extra-inning game.âThatâs a little higher pitch count than my armâs used to,â Glenn said, laughing. âBut thatâs what we condition for. Iâll work hard this week to get my body ready for next week, thatâs for sure.âPenn managed to squeeze across one run in the fourth inning off of a Bossart single, but that was all they could manage until the ninth in what shaped up to be a pitchersâ duel. The game stretched into the ninth inning of what was originally intended to be a seven-inning game. Junior second baseman Ryan Mincher walked to lead off the bottom of the ninth, and after advancing to third base, Betbeze drove him in for the walk-off win.That was just part of a banner weekend for Betbeze, who batted a torrid .615 (8-for-13) in this weekendâs action.âIâve been a lot more aggressive early in the count, trying to get fastballs when theyâre attacking me with fastballs,â Betbeze, who entered this weekend hitless in 11 at-bats, said.Betbeze began the weekend batting seventh, but he later moved all the way to the leadoff spot by the end of Monday. Thatâs a place where Yurkow would like to keep him. âIâd really like to lead Connor [Betbeze] off,â Yurkow said. âIâd like to move everybody else back in the lineup. Iâd love to have him at the top of the order.âThe Quakers again took the field for their final game on Monday afternoon. Tied 2-2 in the bottom of the fifth, Bossart doubled to drive in Tesch, giving Penn a 3-2 lead. However, an error by senior shortstop Mitch Montaldo in the top of the ninth would cost the Quakers, as that runner came around to score, tying the game to send it to the bottom of the ninth.With McKinnon on third, Tesch stepped up to the plate with the chance to play the hero once again. He did not disappoint. Tesch singled, driving McKinnon over to third base. And, like the previous day, Penn found a stroke of good luck when Harvardâs left fielder fumbled the ball, allowing McKinnon to score to give Penn the win.âYou know, [pressure situations] just donât really bother me too much,â Tesch said. âItâs just another at-bat.âPennâs many close games were stressful for all who watched, including the teamâs coaching staff.âI was joking around with the guys, saying, âGuys, you know, you can win a game by more than five runs, so I donât have to bite my fingernails off,ââ Yurkow said. However, he isnât complaining about the results.âThis teamâs starting to show some toughness late in games,â Yurkow said, âAnd really, if youâre going to be in championships, youâve got to find a way to be in close games. Youâve got to find a way to win them.âThe Quakers certainly did that against two tough Ivy League opponents. \n",

            "One game at a time, one base at a time.  Penn softball used strong pitching and small-ball offense on Wednesday afternoon to sweep Philadelphia rival La Salle, defeating the Explorers by scores of 3-0 and 5-0. In the first game, strong pitching and good early offense gave the Quakers (9-8) an early lead that they would hold for the entire game. Freshman starting pitcher Julia Longo set the tone for the Red and Blue in the first inning, striking out La Salle (5-12) leadoff hitter and junior shortstop Emily Conway on just four pitches. A diving catch on a foul ball by sophomore catcher Sarah Ketring would finish off the 1-2-3 inning and give the Quakers their first at-bats of the game. In the bottom of the first, Penn was able to get to La Salle sophomore starter Morgan Orlowski early and often with a two-out single up the middle by senior designated hitter Sarah Cwiertnia and a walk by sophomore third baseman Lucy Yang. The Quakers would string together three more two-out singles, the last of which was a bloop single into right by junior left fielder Clare Sebastianelli that would drive home two. âScoring early in the game is really helpful, it just takes a lot off the pitchers shoulders. It's nice knowing that the offense is going to be there to support us and if we give up a run it's not the end of the world,â Longo said. The Quakers would continue the singles streak in the second, as a pair of hits from freshmen Julia Schneider and Emma Nedley gave them runners on first and second. After two wild pitches, Schneider came around to score to give the Red and Blue a 3-0 lead.  âWe are a very station-to-station team, so itâs crucial that we are able to hit the ball on the ground and move runners,â Cwiertnia said.  On the hill, Longo continued her dominance, allowing just one hit and striking out three in four innings of work. After she was done, the Quakers turned to junior Jennifer Brann who was equally effective, finishing off Pennâs shutout with three lockdown innings and two punchouts. Perhaps the cool afternoon breeze took some of the pop out of each team's bats; La Salle would finish with just two hits to the Quakers eight, and all 10 hits were singles. âI was really effective moving in and out on them,â Longo said. âMy screwball is probably one of my most effective pitches, so early in the game I was able to jam them inside. By the second and third inning, they started backing of the plate, so I needed to use my curveball.â The second game was much of the same with both teams putting runners on base. However, they both failed to generate any real scoring chances. With Penn sophomore starter Abigail Abramson trading zeros with La Salle freshman pitcher Cailey Joyce, the game was scoreless entering the bottom of the fourth.  La Salle removed Joyce from the game, and the Quakers once again worked to manufacture runs against the new pitcher, senior Marlo Roadcap. Three walks loaded the bases for freshman shortstop Ashley Waco with just one out. Waco would bounce a swinging bunt up the first-base line, and Explorers sophomore first baseman Ashley Mendenhall played for the inning-ending double play by attempting to tag Waco before throwing home.  However, sophomore Kayla Ketring, who was serving as a pinch runner, raced home to beat the throw. Penn soon tacked on two more runs as Schneider roped a two-RBI single to right, extending the lead to 3-0.  âEarly in the game, we did a really good job of having quality at-bats and putting the ball in play. Even when people did get out, they were hard hit balls,â Cwiertnia said. âEventually the ball will start to fall in a spot where nobody is.â With the bats finally heating up, Penn got back to business against Joyce, who re-entered the game for La Salle in the fifth. A double by Nedley, followed by a single from senior second baseman Sam Pederson, put two on for Kayla Ketring. The sophomore lined a shot that bounced just inches fair and would find the left field corner, driving in both runs with a two-RBI double. With the way Penn had been pitching all day, this knock would be the one to finish off the Explorers. The Quakers' pitchers would finish the double-header with 14 shutout innings, striking out 11 and surrendering just eight hits. âThe pitching sets the tone,â Cwiertnia said. âIt gets us in the mentality of how the game is going to go, and I think they did a really good job today.â The team will look to keep up the strong performances on the mound as it prepares for Harvard at home this weekend.\n",

            " One step backward, three steps forward.   After dropping its first Ivy contest of the 2014 season and splitting two games on Saturday, Penn baseball responded in emphatic fashion on Sunday, capturing another two wins against Lou Gehrig Division-rival Cornell.   Entering this weekendâs four-game series with the Big Red (15-14, 6-6 Ivy), the Quakers had won 14 of their past 16 contests, including their first eight games in Ivy play.   But facing Cornellâs star sophomore lefty Michael Byrne   in the series opener, Pennâs momentum came to a grinding halt as the Big Red rolled to a 9-0 win.   The second-year southpaw limited the Red and Blue (19-12, 11-1) to five hits and notched eight strikeouts in six innings. Though the Quakers remained within striking distance for most of the game, junior pitcher Dan Gautieri   was tagged for five runs in five and one-third innings.   But the Red and Blue rebounded in the second game on Saturday as rookie pitcher Jake Cousins   stifled Cornellâs offense. After giving up a run in the first inning, Cousins settled down, holding the Big Red   to five hits in five and two-thirds innings of work.   âJake has been great for us this season,â coach John Yurkow   said. âAt that point [on Saturday], the series really could have gone either way.   We had to have that game,   and he came out with a great fastball,   and he gave us a chance to win it.â   Pennâs bats gave Cousins plenty of support, as junior Jeff McGarry   went 3-for-5 with a double and a run batted in. Sophomore second baseman Mike Vilardo   had two hits, while sophomore shortstop Ryan Mincher   and junior third baseman Mitch Montaldo   each added two RBI to help the Quakers notch the 11-2 win.   âI was really proud of the way we bounced back,â Yurkow said. âIn the first game, we were really sloppy,   and we came back and responded [in the second game], and we were able to carry that momentum into [Sunday].â   With that momentum in tow, the Quakers wasted no time striking against the Big Red in Sundayâs first matchup. After junior pitcher Connor Cuff   retired Cornellâs first three batters, senior outfielder Brandon Engelhardt   led off with a triple and subsequently scored on sophomore catcher Austin Bossartâs   RBI single.   âBrandon Engelhardt really got us going.   First pitch he smokes a triple,â Yurkow said. âAnd we barreled up some balls early, and we could just feel the energy in the dugout. We got up on them, and we could just feel the momentum all day.â   Though the Red and Blue scored in each of the first three innings of Sundayâs early game, Cornellâs Brent Jones   matched Cuff in a pitcherâs duel for five-plus innings. Jones held the Quakers to four hits, but four Big Red errors didnât do the junior any favors.   Still, despite Cornellâs sloppiness, the Big Red had a chance to tie the game in the fifth inning.   With runners on first and second, JD Whetsel   notched a base hit up the middle. As left fielder Jordan Winawer   rounded third and attempted to score, Engelhardt gunned a throw from center to nail the runner at the plate, helping the Quakers preserve their one-run lead.   âTo be honest, when that ball first got hit, I didnât think [Brandon] was going to have a chance,â Yurkow said. âI didnât think weâd get him, but Brandon came up and made a perfect throw,   and that was a huge momentum shift.â   Cuff finished off the complete game two innings later, giving Penn a 4-2 win while picking up his fourth win of the season.   In the series finale, the Red and Blue wasted no time, picking up where they   left off earlier in the afternoon. The Quakers rattled Cornellâs Paul Balestrieri   early, scoring six runs in the first three innings on their way to a 9-2 victory.   Senior Rick Brebner   went 3-for-4 with an RBI while Mincher and sophomore   Matt Greskoff combined for six additional RBI.   Though junior Ronnie Glenn   had runners on first and second base in each of the first four innings, he managed to escape unscathed, delivering six shutout innings while allowing only six hits.   With its first four-game weekend series out of the way, Penn now turns its attention to its final nonconference game of the season against University of the Sciences on Tuesday before heading to Princeton for four games next weekend.  \n",

            "The Quakers had the fight, but it wasnât quite enough.  Penn baseball came into this weekendâs series against Columbia having to win at least two of the three games in order to keep its hopes for a spot in the Ivy League Championship Series (ILCS) alive. Despite putting themselves in a position to win a pair of games, the Quakers came up just short in this feat. Columbia and Penn split Saturdayâs doubleheader, in what was an up-and-down afternoon, to say the least. Penn won the first matchup, 3-2, while the Lions quickly got their revenge with a 20-4 thrashing of the Quakers. Sundayâs finale was a tight one, in which Columbia pulled away in the late innings and took an 8-6 victory. The first game of the set featured a pitcherâs duel between Pennâs senior ace Gabe Kleiman and Columbia sophomore Jordan Chriss. The Columbia lefty put together an efficient performance, giving up just three runs in 8.1 innings. Kleiman was even better, however, as he threw a complete game masterpiece. The left-hander allowed two runs on five hits, while striking out a career-high 12 batters. The few runs that were scored proved to be vital. Each teamâs junior first baseman, Sean Phelan for Penn (13-24-1, 7-10-1 Ivy) and Chandler Bengtson for Columbia (16-24, 11-7 Ivy), hit a solo home run to make the score 1-1 through two innings.  Penn jumped out to a 2-1 lead with a third-inning RBI single from freshman second baseman/left fielder Eddie Malinowski, which plated fellow freshman left fielder Christian Walton. The Quakers tacked on to this lead, as junior catcher Matt OâNeill drove in sophomore shortstop/second baseman Chris Adams in the seventh frame. This two-run cushion is what allowed Kleiman to give up a solo home run in the ninth and still escape with a 3-2 victory. The momentum from the first game certainly didnât carry over into game two. Entering the bottom of the sixth, the Quakers found themselves trailing 6-4. The offense was aided by sophomore right fielder Peter Mattâs two-RBI single in the first inning and junior third baseman Matt McGeaghâs pair of RBIs, one of which came off of a solo shot in the sixth inning.  From there, however, Columbiaâs bats got hot and would not cool down. The Lions scored 14 unanswered runs in the sixth, seventh, and eighth innings to run away with the ballgame. Penn was able to regroup for Sundayâs single-game finale, an affair that proved to be a game of momentum shifts. The Red and Blue drew first blood with McGeaghâs RBI single off of the glove of Columbiaâs diving third baseman.  Penn sophomore starting pitcher and reigning Big Five Pitcher of the Week Mitchell Holcomb was pitching a shutout until the Lions finally got to him in the fifth inning, scoring five runs in that frame. This time, however, the Quakers had an answer for Columbiaâs bats. The Penn offense put together its own five run inning in the sixth, highlighted by RBIs from Malinowski, Phelan, Matt, and senior center fielder Andrew Murnane. Down 6-5 entering the bottom half of the sixth, the Lions showed why they are near the top of the Ivy standings. In this frame, Columbia sophomore designated hitter Liam McGill knotted the game at six apiece with a double down the left field line to plate junior left fielder Ben Porter. Two innings later, Porter got an RBI single of his own and was again knocked in by McGill to give the Lions an 8-6 lead. Penn made it interesting in the ninth, getting two runners into scoring position, but the team couldnât capitalize on this opportunity and fell 8-6 to lose the series.  The Red and Blue will get a week off before taking on Villanova on May 9. After that game, Penn will face Yale in the final series of the season. The Quakers will certainly be looking to get revenge against the Elis after they lost to them in the ILCS last year.\n",

            "The season series between Penn baseball and Lafayette officially goes to the Quakers.Just two weeks after splitting a four-game series with the Leopards, the Red and Blue defeated their Easton, Pa., rivals, 6-5, on the road.Playing in their second game in the Liberty Bell Classic â following a 9-4 loss to Villanova last week â the Quakers (11-12) came out in a hurry on Tuesday. Still, although Penn got two men on with one out in the first, junior right-hander Trevor Houck got out of trouble unscathed for Lafayette (9-16).Such would not be the case in the next two innings.After senior shortstop Ryan Mincher led off the second with a triple, freshman catcher Matt OâNeill quickly scored him on a sac fly. In the third, junior designated hitter Tim Graul kicked off a two-out rally with a double â his league-best ninth on the year â and scored on the next play after Leopards shortstop Steven Cohen booted a ball hit by freshman first baseman Sean Phelan.The next at-bat, Phelan crossed the plate on an RBI single from sophomore left fielder Daniel Halevy â who would score himself on a single from OâNeill just a short while later.âThe offense did a good job of getting runs up on the board,â said junior southpaw Adam Bleday, who got the start for the Quakers, allowing one run in five innings for his first win of the year. âAnd that helped me cruise and pitch to my best performance.Up comfortably, 4-0, Bleday coasted through the first half of the game. Allowing just three hits and striking out three through four frames, the only blemish on Bledayâs outing was an unearned run in the fifth after a throwing error allowed Cohen to score.âI pitch to contact, so if they do indeed get hits off me itâs fine,â Bleday noted. âBecause Iâm a contact pitcher, Iâm just going to try and get as many ground balls as I can.âJunior Jack Hartman stepped onto the rubber in the sixth, replacing Bleday as Penn held the 4-1 advantage. After walking the first batter he faced, a botched pickoff attempt allowed Cohen to get to third, and he subsequently scored on a sacrifice fly to center field.Defensive troubles have plagued the Quakers of late, and only one of Lafayetteâs five runs was earned on the afternoon. Those miscues remain a large concern for Penn coach John Yurkow.âWhen youâre playing better teams, if youâre going to continue to make mistakes like that, youâre going to come up short,â he said.The Leopards threatened again in the seventh, getting runners on second and third with two outs, but Hartman sent senior Jackson Kramer down swinging to get out of trouble.For good measure, the Quakers plated some insurance runs in the top of the ninth. Freshman Matt Tola laid down a sacrifice bunt with two men on and moved OâNeill and pinch runner Andrew Murnane over for the first out of the inning. OâNeill soon scored on a passed ball, giving the Red and Blue a 5-2 edge. With Murnane now on third, freshman third baseman Matt McGeagh poked one through the left side for an RBI single.In the bottom of the ninth, a leadoff walk was followed by a base on error as Hartman found himself in quick trouble. A pair of singles scored a run to make it 6-3 and forced Yurkow to bring in freshman closer Jake Nelson with the bases loaded and no outs.After hitting the first batter he faced to bring in a run, Nelson forced Kramer to pop out to second, getting the first out of the inning. Cohen then hit a sac fly to center for the second out as Pennâs lead shrunk to just one. With runners on second and third and a one-run lead, Nelson worked right fielder Dan Leckie into a 2-2 count before forcing a game-ending ground out to third.âHe made some good pitches when he really needed to, when the pressure was on,â Yurkow noted. âSo it was a good sign to see that.âIt wasnât pretty, but it got the job done. And because of it, the Quakers take a four-game winning streak into a four-game road trip to Harvard and Dartmouth this weekend.\n",

            "The climb up the Ivies starts now. In the first Ivy series of the season, Penn baseball split Saturdayâs doubleheader but lost on Sunday to Harvard at Meiklejohn Stadium. Game one put an end to the Quakersâ seven-game winning streak, while the second contest marked their seventh win when scoring at least 10 runs. Game one, pitched by junior Christian Scafidi, seemed to be Harvardâs from the very beginning. The Crimson (10-5, 2-1 Ivy) hit two home runs right away before senior first baseman Sean Phelan responded with a homer of his own in the bottom of the first.  In the second inning, Harvard scored two runs off of a double, and one more off a single. Before the Quakers (11-6, 1-2) could get back on the board, the Crimson added three runs off a homer to left field. The Quakers and Crimson each scored two runs in the fifth inning. Harvard fortified its lead with an RBI double, but the Quakers brought it back to a three-run deficit with an RBI single by freshman shortstop Josh Hood. In the eighth, Harvard scored three more. While the Quakers clawed back in the game with a few runs in the ninth, it was too little too late, and the Crimson won, 12-9.  In Saturdayâs second game, the Quakers scooped up their first Ivy win of the year, with junior Mitchell Holcomb starting the contest on the hill. Although Harvard started off hot again with a two-run RBI triple, Hood cut the lead by one with his first collegiate home run.  In the third inning, Harvard brought the score to 3-1 with a home run. In response, Penn freshman second baseman Craig Larsen hit an RBI double, bringing junior right fielder Peter Matt home. Hood followed up with another RBI double, plating three of his teammates. In the fifth frame, Hood nailed his second home run of the day to put Penn up by a score of 8-5. âIn previous games, I just feel like I wasnât keeping my head on the ball â I noticed that in between games when we were warming up,â Hood said. âI tried to make that adjustment as much as I could before the game, and I was able to see the ball pretty well.â The eighth inning helped to put the Quakers in the lead for good. Senior third baseman Matt McGeagh hit a sacrifice fly to plate Hood, and that was followed by a two-RBI single by Phelan, allowing sophomore left fielder Eduardo Malinowski and sophomore designated hitter Jackson Petersen to score.  In the series finale on Sunday, the Quakers were the ones who started the scoring, with Hood's RBI single scoring Matt in the bottom of the first. After Harvard scored two runs, Malinowski started the scoring in the fourth by hitting his second homer of the year over the left field wall to drive in two runs. Matt stole second base before advancing to third on an error by the Harvard catcher. The Harvard catcher then sailed a throw over the outstretched arm of his second baseman, allowing both Matt and McGeagh to score. Harvard responded with a homer that sailed into the right field net that protects Route 76 from flying baseballs. Cheers erupted from the Harvard section as Patrick McColl rounded the bases to tie the game at 4-4. Harvard broke a scoring hiatus with a grand slam in the eighth from Jake Suddleson to put the Crimson ahead, 8-4.  Going into the ninth, the Quakers trailed, 8-6. Peterson and Malinowski promptly started a rally with a pair of singles. However, the door slammed shut with a strikeout and double play, which ended the game. âIt was exciting, it was really exciting,â Hood said. âHarvardâs a really good team, but I also think weâre a better team. To lose the series leaves a sour taste in your mouth.â âWe know we have some things to tighten up, and we will,â Phelan said. âGenerally, we played well throughout the series, but there is room for improvement on the field, at bat, and on the mound.\" \"Guys know that and the sentiment is weâre the best team in the League, weâre gonna learn from this weekend and get better.â The Quakers will have a midweek game against Villanova that they can use to strengthen their footing before continuing Ivy play against Brown next weekend.\n",

            "Penn Law Dean Ted Ruger released an official statement denouncing the recently reported comments made by controversial Penn Law professor Amy Wax at the Edmund Burke Foundationâs National Conservatism conference last week. Wax made headlines when her remarks supported an immigration policy favoring immigrants from Western countries over immigrants from non-Western countries. She argued for a position that America would be âbetter off with more whites and fewer nonwhites,â according to reports from Vox, The New York Times, and Buzzfeed.  In his posted response, Ruger stated Wax's remarks were at odds with Penn's values and policies and pledged to work with students to \"heal\" from the experience.  âAt best, the reported remarks espouse a bigoted theory of white cultural and ethnic supremacy; at worst, they are racist,\" Ruger wrote.  Wax had emphasized in multiple emails to The Daily Pennsylvanian that the attention she had been getting after her remarks were from news articles instead of from a video or a full transcript of her speech. On Ruger's statement, she wrote, \"He released a statement on the REPORTS on my conference remarks. He couldnât be bothered to wait for a transcript or audio recording to be released.\" At the time Ruger's statement was released, a partial transcript of her speech had been published by Voxâs journalist Zack Beauchamp, who attended and reported on her remarks at the conference. The Federalist released a complete transcript of Wax's remarks on July 26. In his statement, Ruger also wrote that Penn Law has hired 10 tenured or tenure-track professors since 2016, half of whom are people of color and more than half of whom are women. Ruger said Penn Law will have âthe most diverse and accomplished student body in the history of the Law School\" with the induction of the Juris Doctorate Class of 2022 and Master of Laws Class of 2020. Ruger wrote in an email to The DP that supporting a diverse student body and faculty is one of Penn Law's \"highest institutional priorities.\" He added Penn Law will share âconcrete results and structural changes that have resulted from these sustained effortsâ with students and alumni in the weeks leading up to the start of the academic year. Students have criticized Waxâs remarks and started petitions urging the University to fire or relieve Wax of all teaching duties. A statement from the Penn's Latinx Law Students Association condemning Amy Wax's statements as \"racist\" and calling on Penn to relieve her of teaching duties has garnered more than 1800 signatures.  âI know these statements by Professor Wax have caused pain and outrage to many in the Penn community,â Ruger wrote in the statement. âMy colleagues and I pledge to work with you so that together we can heal, and learn from this experience and each other.â In response to students and alumni who raised concerns about Wax's remarks, Ruger said he is \"grateful to work together\" with those who criticize and challenge Penn Law to uphold its mission. âOur diversity makes us a better law school,â Ruger said. The firestorm surrounding Wax's comments on race began after she wrote an op-ed in Aug. 2017 arguing for a return to the 1950s American cultural norms. In an interview with The Daily Pennsylvanian afterwards, Wax said white, Anglo-Protestant cultural norms are superior. Her comments caused backlash from students and faculty, some of whom drafted a petition signed by 33 Penn Law professors \"categorically reject[ing]\" her claims.   Wax returned to a spotlight when she claimed she has never seen a black Penn Law student graduate in the top quarter of their class in a video from fall 2017. Days after the video resurfaced, Ruger announced on March 13, 2018 that Wax would no longer be allowed to teach a mandatory first-year course for breaking school policy by disclosing student grades. In a February 2018 op-ed, Wax wrote that Ruger asked her to take a leave for the next school year after her controversial publications. The discussion of the sabbatical, a form of leave of absence, was routine for tenured faculty, Penn Law spokesperson Steven Barnes said at the time. Wax has scheduled to take her sabbatical for the upcoming school year, Penn spokesperson Stephen MacCarthy confirmed. Editor's Note: The article has been updated to reflect that a complete transcript of Wax's remarks was published by The Federalist. \n",

            "Penn Law School Dean Ted Ruger announced last week that Penn Law professor Amy Wax would be barred from teaching a mandatory first-year course. While students and alumni largely expressed gratitude for this action, many say that more needs to be done for diversity initiatives at the school. After Wax claimed that black Penn Law students never graduated in the top quarter of their class and \"rarely, rarely\" in the top half, students and alumni drafted a petition calling on Ruger to take action against Wax.  Nick Hall, president of the Black Law Student Association and third-year law student, said members of BLSA promoted the petition and spoke with Ruger over spring break. More than 780 people had signed the petition, according to Hall.  âItâs a step in the right direction that Professor Wax has been removed from teaching [first years],â Hall said. âBut there is more work to be done regarding diversity and inclusion at top law schools and we look forward to working with Dean Ruger and his administration to make good on his promise to develop concrete action.â Prof. Amy Wax has violated the spirit of @PennLaw's grade nondisclosure policy by claiming demonstrably false allegations against black students and alumni. #amywaxistheproblem #solvetheproblem #pennlaw #deantedruger #standwithBLSA #blackatpennlaw #pennlawlifeâ Penn Law BLSA (@PennBLSA) March 9, 2018   Wax did not respond to request for comment. Several Penn Law alumni drafted the petition addressed to Ruger the week before spring break, including 2009 Penn Law graduate Amy Laura Cahn, 2003 Penn Law graduate Julius Towers, 1999 Penn Law and Master's of Public Administration graduate Donyale Reavis, and 2012 Penn Law graduates Ayana Lewis and Ginene Lewis.  Ginene Lewis, a former member of BLSA, said her initial âfrustrationâ was less with Wax and more with Law School administrators because they did not react in an âappropriateâ way the last time Wax's controversial statements garnered widespread criticism.  In August 2017, Wax co-authored a controversial op-ed arguing for a return to 1950s American cultural norms. In a subsequent interview with The Daily Pennsylvanian, she said Anglo-Protestant cultural norms are superior. Ginene Lewis added that although she appreciated seeing Ruger take action against Wax, there is still more room for discussion about how the school can further promote diversity. âI walk away from the letter with the hope that the actions Dean Ruger discusses at the end [of the letter] will involve a diverse and inclusive group of people to discuss how the law school moves forward,â she said. Ayana Lewis, who was also involved with BLSA and took Waxâs \"Civil Procedure\" course during her first year at Penn, said she was âlividâ when she heard Waxâs derogatory comments about black students.  She added that she has been actively petitioning against Wax since she was a first-year law student. According to Ayana Lewis, Wax was promoting her book, âRace, Wrongs, and Remedies: Group Justice in the 21st Century,â at an event on campus in fall 2009.  Following the event, Ayana Lewis organized a panel discussion entitled \"Revisiting Race and Remedies: Should the Government Play A Role in Eliminating Racial Disparities in Education and Employment?\" in spring 2010. She said she invited Wax to participate and noted that she brought conservative columnist John Derbyshire as well.  During the debate, Ayana Lewis recalled, Derbyshire made offensive comments about black students and said she later asked Wax during her office hours if she held the same views. âHer response was, âYou can have two [different species of] plants in the forest under the same conditions and one will just grow higher,ââ Ayana Lewis said. âFrom that point on, I was just so furious that [a first year] of any color would be forced to learn from and be in the presence of this woman who was blatantly racist.â Ayana Lewis and other alumni sent the petition to Ruger on March 9 and later met with him to discuss their demands three days later, on March 12. âTo hear that no first-year student will be forced to learn from prof. Wax was a milestone,â Lewis said.  She added, however, that she thinks there is still more work to be done. Although Wax has been barred from teaching mandatory classes, she will still be teaching electives, according to Rugerâs statement. âWe donât think any student who wants to take the courses sheâs teaching should have to take those courses if sheâs the only one teaching them,â Ayana Lewis said. The petition also called on Ruger to remove Wax from the Law Schoolâs Clerkship Committee and any other committees involved with directing the school. Ayana Lewis said that although her position on the committee was not addressed by Rugerâs statement, it is an action for which they plan to continue to push.\n",

            "Changes to the Harvard Law School seal, which displays the crest of a slaveholding family, are in order.On Monday, Harvard Corporation agreed for the Law School to remove and replace its seal, after a recommendation on March 4 made by a Law School committee of students, faculty, staff and alumni.According to The Harvard Crimson, the motion to reconsider the seal began with the student-led âRoyall Must Fallâ movement last fall, named for Isaac Royall Jr., who endowed Harvardâs first law professorship. Students argued that keeping the seal would symbolize the history of the Royall Plantation and endorse a legacy of slaveholding.The Corporationâs decision follows a series of increased attention to historical names and titles on Harvardâs campus. Last month Harvard Collegeâs newly-renamed \"Faculty Deans\" voted to remove the title of âHouse masterâ because of negative racial connotations associated with the word âmaster.âSuch changes call into question whether movements to change historic names do more harm than good, by erasing memories rather than remembering and learning from them. Official removal of the seal is expected by mid-April.\n",

            "Fossil Free Penn will host weekly silent sit-ins every Friday at noon in College Hall, with the intent of pressuring the University to address the climate crisis âto the extent that science and justice demand,â according to the group's page. The first sit-in took place on Sept. 27 outside the office of Penn President Amy Gutmann, with about 40 students and faculty members in attendance. Attendees spoke about their relationships to the cause and drafted an email to key administrators, with a demand for a public town hall where students can engage with administrators on fossil fuel divestment and Penn's plan to reduce carbon emissions.  FFP Actions Coordinator and College senior Jacob Hershman read aloud a prewritten email of their demands to Gutmann, Chairman of the Board of Trustees David Cohen, and Chief Investment Officer Peter Ammon. Hershman sent the email to the administrators, which contained a promise that the student activists were prepared to continue to show up and fight for divestment \"until the end of time.\" After the email was sent, students sat in College Hall for hours, many working on their laptops or speaking quietly to each other to pass the time. âWe want everybody to be there with us,â FFP Coordinator and College sophomore Emma Glasser said. âStudents, faculty, staff. We all have a right to a livable future, and thatâs what weâre fighting for.â  FFP, which organized at the Philadelphia climate strike earlier this month, credits Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg for their new direct action strategy, FFP Campaign Coordinator and College sophomore Maeve Masterson said. Fridays for Future is an international movement of school students who take time off from class in order to demand climate action and engage in demonstrations. Glasser claimed Penn must be invested in fossil fuels because of the rejection of multiple divestment proposals from FFP. In past years, FFP has submitted two divestment proposals, one asking for full divestment from fossil fuels and the other on divestment from coal and tar sands companies.   \"Both of those were rejected, the second one was refused to even be reviewed,\" Masterson said. \"Now weâre employing a more action-oriented tactic, riding on the wave of divestment movements from across the country.â Every semester, group members have also attended Board of Trustees meetings to participate in silent sit-ins.  The University has established efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Penn Sustainability has set emissions goals for Penn through Climate Action Plans. Pennâs Climate Action Plan 2.0, released in 2014, puts the University on track to have a zero net carbon footprint by 2042. Campaign Coordinator and College sophomore Katie Collier said Collier said while the efforts of the Universityâs Sustainability Office are admirable, adequate steps are not being taken to reduce Pennâs carbon emissions to the extent that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report requires.  The IPCC Special Report, released in October 2018, details the impacts of global warming to a temperature of 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels, and states that without urgent reduction in emissions, the planet will experience climate crisis to a catastrophic and irreversible degree by 2030. \"It became a call for action that we need to drastically reduce our carbon emissions in order to avert climate catastrophe,\" Collier said. FFP has sit-ins scheduled for every Friday through the academic year, Glasser said.\n",

            "Penn has announced a range of significant findings into the University's history with slavery. In a statement dated June 28, the University wrote that 75 of Penn's former trustees were slave owners, including Pennâs first Provost, William Smith. The University also paid a Penn professor for work done by an enslaved man whom he owned, and sent faculty members to raise money from slave-owning families.  \"In this and other ways, the labor of enslaved people was used to support and care for Penn faculty and students,\" the statement read.      Statement on Penn's Connections to Slavery (PDF)  Statement on Penn's Connections to Slavery (Text)   Penn President Amy Gutmann also listed five action items that the University planned to take in light of these findings. Apart from supporting further research into the issue, Penn plans to develop a website to serve as a repository of the information, supporting the continued research of the Penn Slavery project, and join the Universities Studying Slavery consortium â a coalition of schools dedicated to studying the legacies on slavery on contemporary life.  Penn's Thursday announcement is a distinct reversal from a position adopted two years ago.  In 2016, after Georgetown University publicly acknowledged the university's own connection to the slave trade, Penn Director of Media Relations Ron Ozio told The Philadelphia Tribune that âPenn has explored this issue several times over the past few decades and found no direct University involvement with slavery or the slave trade.\" Earlier this year, an undergraduate student research study supported by Penn's History Department found that many of the University's founding trustees had substantial connections to the slave trade.   In this \"Penn Slavery Project,\" the students, led by Penn History Professor Kathleen Brown, found that out of the 28 trustees they investigated, 20 of them owned slaves. The group presented their preliminary research on Dec. 11 at College Hall only weeks after the Princeton and Slavery Project unveiled dozens of archival documents about Princeton's ties to slavery.  Penn responded to the students' findings by forming its own working group to investigate the University's ties to slavery after meeting with the students who were part of the research group. \"Our statements last year regarding any further University nexus were based on the best information that was then known to the University Archives,\" Penn spokesperson Stephen MacCarthy said in a statement earlier this year. \"Through the [Penn Slavery Project] student's research, we are now aware of additional information.\"\n",

            " The proposal calling for Penn to divest its $7.7 billion endowment from tobacco companies died without a vote at Fridayâs Board of Trustees meeting.   Board Chair David L. Cohen recognized the detrimental health effects of tobacco but said that it does not constitute a âmoral evil,â excluding it from the grounds of Pennâs divestment policy.   âI am no fan of tobacco,â Cohen said at the meeting. âBut the fact is the manufacture, sale and use of tobacco products is legal in this country.â   Cohen presented alternative methods through which the University can express concerns about tobacco, including sharing the divestment proposal and trustee views with Pennâs current investment managers and discouraging and reducing the use of tobacco within the University.   Newly elected Vice Chair Andrea Mitchell and former Chairman James Riepe spoke in accordance with Cohenâs points.   âAs a cancer survivor and someone who has advocated against tobacco use professionally... I feel that the steps you have outlined are a more effective way for the University to take action,â Mitchell said.   After the brief discussion, Cohen asked the board members if any would like to put forward a resolution for tobacco divestment. None of the roughly two dozen trustees did.   The decision follows an overwhelming wave of divestment support from Penn faculty and the University Council. 530 senior Penn faculty members signed an open letter supporting divestment, and the University Council saw a 51-6 vote in favor of divestment.  \n",

            "Pennâs process of deciding whether or not to divest from fossil fuels is biased.We will start by giving a quick update on our campaign. In February of 2015, Fossil Free Penn initiated a referendum, in which 87.8 percent of voting students voted in favor of divestment from fossil fuel holdings. Then, in October of this year, Fossil Free Penn submitted a proposal outlining the reasons supporting divestment to the Board of Trustees.Soon after, it was deemed that there was enough evidence in support of divestment for an ad hoc committee on divestment to be formed. It is important to note that the Trusteesâ guidelines mandate that this committee must remain impartial and critically examine all of the evidence on both sides. After a delay releasing the names of the members of this committee, the University Secretary finally released the names on Monday, March 1. However, sadly, two members of this committee exhibit clear bias, a detail that jeopardizes the integrity of not just this committee, but the entire divestment consideration process.Climate change is among the most pressing issues facing our world today. It is an issue that is extremely urgent and dire, and it is our responsibility as a university to do everything we can to counteract the effects of our changing climate.However, biased members of the committee responsible for recommending the Board of Trustees to either vote for or against divestment can easily block any forward progress and have reason to, due to either ties to the fossil fuel industry or outspoken disagreement with divestment. The two members with clearly demonstrated bias on the ad hoc committee for divestment are David Roberts, chair and alumni representative of the committee, and Engineering senior Dillon Weber who will be serving on the committee. We are not attacking these members, just pointing out flaws in the sanctity of the committee itself.First, committee chair David Roberts is the current chief operating officer and senior managing director of Angelo, Gordon & Co. Private Equity Group. According to its website, Angelo, Gordon & Co.âs energy lending strategy maintains a âfocus on investments in oil and gas, oilfield service ... and other energy-related companies.â This means that Roberts has a personal stake in the fossil fuel industry through his affiliation with Angelo, Gordon & Co., as the company both invests in and is invested in the fossil fuel industry, displaying clear bias. Roberts is the current chair of the ad hoc committee and should therefore be the member with the least opportunity for bias, not the other way around.The other member who displays clear bias against divestment is Dillon Weber. Weber has spoken out against divestment many times. Weber wrote articles and arguments against divestment from the fossil fuel industry in both the Penn Sustainability Review in 2015 and in The Statesmen Energy Issue in 2013. In December 2015, Weber openly spoke out against divestment to the University Council at its Open Forum and, on December 3 of 2015, was quoted in an article by The Daily Pennsylvanian stating divestment is ânot a good toolâ and that divestment would be a âhypocritical and empty gesture.â Because Mr. Weber already made up his mind on divestment back in 2013, and has not issued a public recant since then, by definition it is impossible for him to âremain impartial.âIt is important to note that none of the other members have any publicly stated bias in favor of divestment. With some members of this committee so clearly biased against divestment, it is difficult not to question the legitimacy of an entire process designed to assess whether divestment is necessary. It is important to not only uncover the biases in the ad hoc committee, but also in other steps of the process including the Board of Trusteesâ final vote on whether to divest.Do we as a student body really want to put the future of our university and planet in the hands of those who are clearly biased against divestment, the most impactful and symbolic action that a university can take against climate change? For us, the answer is a resounding no.     ZACH RISSMAN is a College freshman and the current Student Outreach Co- Coordinator of Fossil Free Penn \n",

            "Members of Divest Harvard blocked the doors to Harvard University's University Hall early Wednesday morning to demand the university divest from coal, The Boston Globe reported.The group called for an immediate âmoratoriumâ on investments in coal and demanded a meeting with the whole school to talk about fossil fuel divestment more broadly, the Harvard Crimson reported.Divest Harvard has repeatedly called on the university to divest from fossil fuels, much like Fossil Free Penn. FFP and Divest Harvard's movements have both seen increased momentum in the past few days, which may have been partly sparked by Columbia Universityâs announcement last month that Columbia's trustees voted in favor of divesting from thermal coal. Harvard Universityâs administration released a statement to the Boston Globe about the most recent protests, writing, âWe agree that climate change is one of the worldâs most urgent and serious issues, but we respectfully disagree with Divest Harvard on the means by which a university should confront it.\" This mirrors a statement that Penn spokesperson Steve MacCarthy emailed to The Daily Pennsylvanian in the beginning of FFP's current protest. \"The University would be happy to work with [FFP] to find additional ways to reduce Pennâs carbon footprint and lessen the need for fossil fuel use,\" he wrote. \"We are in agreement with them on the importance of this issue. We simply disagree on strategy: they are demanding that Penn divest, and the [Board of] Trustees have already determined that fossil fuel does not meet the Universityâs criteria for divestment.\"College sophomore and FFP member Zach Rissman said FFP and Divest Harvard have even been collaborating on their tactics through an Ivy League divestment student network. \n",

            "For the first time since Penn Law professor Amy Wax made headlines last year for controversial comments on race and free speech, the University that employs her has responded with action.  Penn Law Dean Ted Ruger announced on Mar. 13 that Amy Wax would no longer be allowed to teach a mandatory first-year course. This comes days after students and alumni responded with outrage to a video of Wax saying she's never seen a black Penn Law student graduate in the top quarter of their class. Earlier this week, an online petition was launched calling on Ruger to take action against Wax for her comments.  Ruger responded publicly for the first time in an email where he defended Wax's right to free speech but stated that she had violated policy by mentioning students' grades. \"As a scholar she is free to advocate her views, no matter how dramatically those views diverge from our institutional ethos and our considered practices,\" Ruger wrote. \"As a teacher, however, she is not free to transgress the policy that student grades are confidential, or to use her access to those Penn Law students who are required to be in her class to further her scholarly ends without studentsâ permission.\" Wax has made controversial remarks on race in the past. \"Here's a very inconvenient fact, Glenn,\" Wax said in the discussion titled 'The Downside to Social Uplift,' which was part of a series hosted by Brown professor Glenn Loury. \"I don't think I've ever seen a black student graduate in the top quarter of the [Penn Law School] class and rarely, rarely in the top half,\" Wax said of her belief in the downside of affirmative action in universities. \"I can think of one or two students who've graduated in the top half of my required first-year course.\" I'm unsurprised by Amy Wax's behavior. She regularly engages in sophomoric/unfounded racial provocation and insult in public AND private. Glad Penn Law is protecting 1L's from her potential academic & professional injury.â Imani Perry (@imaniperry) March 14, 2018  In the email, Ruger explicitly stated that her claims are false.  \"[B]lack students have graduated in the top of the class at Penn Law, and the Law Review does not have a diversity mandate. Rather, its editors are selected based on a competitive process,\" the email read. \"And contrary to any suggestion otherwise, black students at Penn Law are extremely successful, both inside and outside the classroom, in the job market, and in their careers.\" Update: The Dean of Penn Law has agreed to remove Amy Wax from mandatory 1L classes!\" I have decided that Professor Wax will continue to teach elective courses in her areas of expertise, but that are outside of the mandatory first-year curriculum.\" #PennLaw #AmyWaxIsTheProblemâ Hey Auntie (@ToniInMyCitie) March 13, 2018   In his expression of support for Wax's right to free speech, Ruger maintained that Wax's status and course-load at the University will remain the same for the upcoming academic year.  Because of these statements, however, Wax would no longer be allowed to teach mandatory first-year courses. Ruger added that he made the decision after consulting with \"faculty, alumni/ae, Overseers, and University officials.\" \"Our first-year students are just that â students â not faceless data points or research subjects to be conscripted in the service of their professorâs musings about race in society,\" he continued.  Various members of the Penn community have been calling for Wax's removal from the mandatory first-year course since she co-wrote a provocative op-ed in August 2017 arguing for a return to 1950s American cultural norms. In a subsequent interview with The Daily Pennsylvanian, she said Anglo-Protestant cultural norms are superior.  In a more recent op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal, Wax alleged that Ruger asked her \"to take a leave of absence next year and to cease teaching a mandatory first-year course.\" At the time, Penn Law spokesperson Steven Barnes said that nothing had changed in her status with the University.

The information regarding the threat did not specify a school, the Federal Bureau of Investigation told DPS, but mentioned the date Monday, Oct. 5, 2015 and the time 2 p.m. ET.âThis is about spreading the information that DPS prepares for any and all emergencies, not making students and staff anxious,â Vice President for Public Safety Maureen Rush said.  âWe donât take these things lightly and we feel that information is power and we want the Penn community to be aware.\"The advisory comes at a time of heightened sensitivity to threats on college campuses, as a shooter at Umpqua Community College in Oregon killed 10 people and injured seven more just this past Thursday. The shooter reportedly indicated his planned violence in social media posts prior to the attack. Drexel University referenced the incident in a statement on its public safety site, noting that the identified threat to a Philadelphia school had also been made on social media.

            " The undergraduate student hospitalized earlier this month with meningococcal meningitis was released from the hospital this weekend, according to University spokeswoman Phyllis Holtzman. There are no further cases of meningococcal infection, she added. Student Health Service posted an update on its Web site about the student's release on Saturday. The student was hospitalized on March 7, and was in critical condition until last week. Meningococcal meningitis is a serious infection of the central nervous system that manifests itself in symptoms like fever, stiff neck, severe headache and nausea. The student was infected with strain B, according to Holtzman. Strain B - one of the five strains of meningococcal infection - is the only strain for which there is no known vaccine. The meningococcal vaccine protects against the other four strains, known as A, C, Y, and W-153. Strain B is also the strain contracted by the three other students who were hospitalized with meningococcal infection between Feb. 12 and 13. Despite this similarity, SHS director Evelyn Wiener said earlier this month that the most recent case is unrelated to the three previous cases. In addition to the three confirmed cases of meningococcal infection last month, two students were hospitalized with flu-like symptoms on Feb. 15. They were never confirmed to have the infection. These hospitalized students each had contact through the Greek system, University officials said at the time of the outbreak. As a result, SHS preventively treated over 3,000 students with the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin. In this case, however, the student had no connections to the Greek community, and University and City officials did not believe widespread distribution of antibiotics was necessary. Then-College sophomore Anne Ryan died of meningitis in 2007. Her family sued the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, alleging she was initially misdiagnosed, and the case is still pending.

            "The Division of Public Safety strongly disputes claims in a Tuesday Philadelphia Daily News article that a Penn Police officer inappropriately handled a fight involving a Philadelphia assistant district attorney. âThe incident portrayed in the newspaper was not accurate as it relates to the intervention Penn Police made,â Vice President for Public Safety Maureen Rush told The Daily Pennsylvanian. The Daily News article described an Oct. 11 fight which broke out at Mad Mex between Philadelphia ADA Kevin Harden and an unnamed Penn employee. The DAâs office was not available for comment as of Tuesday night. Sources in the article called Harden the âaggressorâ in the incident, and the Mad Mex service manager told the Daily News that the Penn Police officer on the scene greeted Harden âas if they were friends.â âThe officer and the ADA recognized each other from a recreational class they had taken,â said Rush, who oversees Penn Police. But she added that the fact that the officer knew Harden had no bearing on how he handled the incident. Related: Arresteesâ names not in campus crime log The Daily News article quoted Mad Mex service manager Matt Park saying that he recalled Harden telling the officer on the scene, âI punched a guy.â He went on to say that he saw âundertones of preferential treatmentâ and wondered why, if Harden âadmitted to punching the other guy,â there had been no arrest. Harden was not charged for any crimes. âWhen the police arrived on site â¦ the fight was already over,â Rush said to the DP. âGenerally, police cannot make an arrest for a misdemeanor offense if they donât witness the crime [under the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure].â Park declined to comment further to the DP. The article also noted that DPS Director of Operations and External Affairs Kathleen Shields Anderson, whom the Daily News contacted for comment, had been an attorney at the Philadelphia District Attorneyâs office at the same time as Harden. Rush called the reference âirrelevant because she was not at the sceneâ of the incident. Related: Safety measures delayed at problem intersection The Daily News also requested a copy of the incident report from Shields Anderson. She referred him to University Communications following DPSâ position regarding outside media, Rush said. It is DPS policy to only give out incident reports to âpeople who are the subject of the report or for when a subpoena or other court order is produced,â Rush said, âand in the case of criminal trials, [they] would be provided to the court.â It was not a âconspiracy,â she added. âThe Pennsylvania Crimes Code is very clear on the situation that happened at Mad Mex.â Correction: A previous version of this article stated that under the Pennsylvania Crime Victims Act, police cannot make an arrest for a misdemeanor offense if they donât witness the crime. The act governing this behavior is the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, not the Pennsylvania Crime Victims Act.\n",

            "Two Penn students, Dante Benitez and Ivan Loginov, were in court this week over a brawl last spring that led to their suspension from Penn, significant injuries to Wharton sophomore Max Arias and a slew of criminal charges. Benitez and Loginov, who entered Penn as members of the Class of 2020, are both accused of assaulting Arias, causing him to sustain a concussion, bloody bruises and a fractured nose and wrist, according to court documents.At a preliminary hearing on Aug. 17, three felony charges against Benitez and Loginov, which included aggravated assault and burglary, were dropped. They will still face misdemeanor charges of conspiracy to commit simple assault, simple assault and recklessly endangering another person.During the hearing, the defense team argued that Benitez and Loginov acted to protect a 19-year-old woman from a potential sexual assault. During the incident, which happened in early April, the attorney for Benitez said he and Loginov did not intend to harm Arias, but instead were trying to prevent him from touching the woman, whom the two feared was too drunk to consent to sexual activity. âA number of people â including Mr. Benitez â who are friends with the 19-year-old woman, believed that she was clearly too intoxicated to consent to have sex with someone,â Ronald Greenblatt, who represented Benitez during the preliminary hearing, said during the hearing, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. âThey went there to try and stop that from happening. They didnât go there to commit a crime.â Assistant District Attorney Lori Edelman argued in court that the defendants were âviolent aggressorsâ and âknew exactly what they were doing.â She also said, in comments reported by the Inquirer, that after beating Arias in his dorm room, the fight continued in the hall and Benitez and Loginov threw him down a flight of stairs. The studentsâ trial will begin on Sept. 18. \n",

            "Puppets, zombies and boxers. These are just a few of the characters that 1995 College graduate Todd Lieberman has worked on and developed throughout his career in Hollywood as a movie producer. On Friday, Liebermanâs latest film âWarm Bodiesâ hit screens around the country. âWarm Bodiesâ is a zombie love story set during the apocalypse but it is a film that doesnât take itself too seriously. âThe film is making light of the earnestness of those genres, but treading that fine line [so] that it doesnât become a spoof,â Lieberman said. âIt is a romance, action, horror and comedy â all of these blended together,â he added. Liebermanâs latest film has captured studentsâ attentions precisely for its blend of different genres. âI basically watch every movie trailer, but this one caught my eye because its meshes the new popular genre of zombie, vampire movies that are currently big in Hollywood, with romantic movies as well,â College freshman Efraim Saltzman said. College freshman Neera Thavornvanit agreed,âI want to go see the movie because its different from other movies that Iâve seen â¦ it combines both a scary plot line with a romance and I think thatâs going to be really interesting.â The movie is based off of a book with the same title by Isaac Marion, published in November 2011. The novel is about a young zombie who falls in love with a human girl. When the materials landed on Liebermanâs desk, he thought it was âreally uniqueâ and had a tone that he hadnât really seen before in this type of genre. Lieberman has worked on a variety of films since leaving Penn. He has produced movies spanning multiple genres, including âThe Muppets,â âThe Proposalâ and âThe Fighterâ â which got him nominated for an Academy Award for best motion picture in January 2011. âThe job of a producer is to have taste enough to be discerning and find things that I love and hope that the general public will love them as well,â Lieberman said. His love for producing began at a young age and developed through his time at Penn. He wrote, directed and produced for the group Mask and Wig, which is the oldest all-male collegiate musical comedy troupe in America. According to Lieberman, Penn helped âthrough Mask and Wig and took those same exact desiresâ for storytelling and made them grow. Lieberman said that the troupe became his mentors, and eventually helped him land his first job in the entertainment business. Ryan Dew, a College senior and chair of Mask and Wig said, â[The group] gives an incredible experience for people who want experience at comedy writing because itâs not just for a class but something where you work with a group of people.â The writers for Mask and Wig produce full-length shows in the spring, Dew said. It gives them the opportunity to come up with funny ideas, incorporate them into a show and discover what things work and what donât. âA lot of people say they came to college and majored in Mask and Wig and minored in whatever they studied,â Dew said. Though Lieberman has been gone from Penn almost two decades, his experience here still influences his life today. âI always loved the idea of people being able to tell stories and move people in emotional ways,â Lieberman said. âPenn helped grow that.â\n",

            "From sketches of fruit to paintings of llamas, the artwork showcased in the Rotunda Saturday afternoon was original and varied.  The student-sponsored event was organized by the Penn Art Club and consisted of student musical performances and a gallery exhibition, both featuring work by over 40 talented Penn students. Some of the featured art was created the previous weekend in Harrison College House at the Penn Art Club's Art-In, during which the students were provided with supplies and worked on art projects for 12 hours. Musical performances at the Art Show ranged from acoustic covers to original music by Penn musicians and bands, such as Unemployed.  Rish Chaudhuri, a Wharton senior in Unemployed, was thrilled that his band's voice was heard. \"There is so much talent that is not being showcased,\" said Chaudhuri. \"This show is a great idea, and my band loved the idea of playing some of our original music, as well as covers of classics such as Jimmy Hendrix, at the Art Show.\" College senior Catherine Prewitt, who performed on guitar, found that the Art Show provided an opportunity to reveal Penn's hidden talent. \"Arts are something Penn students should be celebrated for,\" she said. Penn Art Club's mission focuses on providing busy Penn students with a chance to participate in fine arts, according to the group's Web site. Through speakers, community service and exhibitions such as the Art Show, Penn Art Club hopes that a broad range of students can access the visual arts. Hilary Gerstein, a College freshman, said, \"People may create art, but often lack a venue to show it. The Art Show does just this.\" She added that as a musician, \"it is often hard to showcase your talent unless you have an opportunity like this.\" One of the artists featured at the show, College junior Alexander Jacobson, said he was pleased to see the audience's reactions to his black and white sketches and ink drawings.  \"The idea of an exhibit is great. I think it is cool because with music you get feedback, but as an artist you never get this unless your art is featured at a gallery opening,\" said Jacobson. \"It was nice to see what people thought about my art.\" \n",

            "The Mask and Wig Clubâs âA Volcanic Corruption: Sun Intendedâ erupted onto the stage for the first time at Mask and Wigâs clubhouse in Center City this weekend. The show marks the 123rd annual production for the Club, the Universityâs âoldest all-male musical comedy troupe.â The show tells the story of three dysfunctional siblings stranded on an island. After one is captured by local tribesmen, the three engage in a power struggle â while the free siblings want to find their way home, the third wants to use the time to repair their relationship. The islandâs volcano threatens to thwart all of their plans. The opening weekend shows Friday and Saturday received positive reviews from crowds of students, friends, former Club members and other guests, who seemed to agree the show was âhilarious.â âI was laughing the whole time,â College freshman Zack Tabor said after the Saturday performance. Former Club members Pat Pow-anpongkul, a 2009 Wharton graduate and Jamie McCarthy, a 2009 Engineering graduate, were also pleased. âOut of all the Wig shows Iâve seen, [âA Volcanic Corruptionâ] had the best music, writing and staging,â McCarthy said. âA Volcanic Corruptionâ arrived on the scene after hard preparation, members were quick to explain. First, the junior and senior troupe members â called âClubbiesâ â write and rehearse a basic âskeleton showâ each summer, said College senior Billy Frierson, one of the showâs cast members and co-writers. âThen we trimmed, prepped and pruned it to make [A Volcanic Corruption].â The group rehearsed thirteen hours a day on weekends and five to six hours on weekdays, College freshman and cast member Zach Tomasovic said. âIt was a lot of hard work â¦ [but] weâre so excited for our audiences.â Other cast members, including College junior David Thayer, agreed. âEvery night is a new playground,â he said. Indeed, gauging from Friday and Saturdayâs crowds, Mask and Wigâs frequently inappropriate antics inspire lighthearted play in its audience. âIn the end,â said Tabor, âI think everyone can enjoy coming together to watch grown, hairy men dance and sing in drag to give us a laugh.â The musical runs until April 8 every weekend at the Mask and Wig Clubhouse except during Pennâs spring break in March, when the Club will take the show on tour to New York City, Pittsburgh, Chicago and Detroit. âWeâre putting everyone on a bus and taking the show with us,â Engineering senior and Mask and Wig Chairman Omar Maskati said. âWeâve had so much fun making it and hope that audiences enjoy it just as much.â\n",

            " Taking an SNL-inspired route, the Mask and Wig Clubâs fall show âAn Eye for an Islandâ will feature more digital media.   Using a projection screen on the stage alongside the performers, Mask and Wig will display digital sketches and a picture slideshow to compliment their traditional act.   âA lot of comedy content has shifted to YouTube, so we want to be able to approach that medium more successfully,â said Wharton senior and the undergraduate chairman of Mask and Wig Rishi Simha   on their new endeavor. âI donât think our YouTube channel reflects the comedic talent of the group.â   Mask and Wig has tried to experiment with digital content before, but has only presented a digital sketch once,   at last yearâs fall show. The difficulty comes in predicting how funny their final product will turn out, members said.   âWe tried writing more visual bits,â said Mask and Wig cast director and College senior Joe Miciak.   âWhen we pitch them, itâs hard because itâs hard to imagine what a video is going to look like.â   Unlike their musicals produced in the spring, Mask and Wigâs fall shows are comprised of different sketches, similar to Saturday Night Live. âAll of our bits can be ridiculous, out there,â Miciak said, describing the fall showâs theme. âThereâs a reoccurring theme of people crashing onto an island, of being judged for past wrongdoings and atoning for those past wrongdoings.â   Another feature of the fall show that breaks   from tradition is the music played in between sketches by the Mask and Wig Band. âOur song selection has veered away as much from the pop-y kind of stuff, and more into some metal and ska,â band director and Engineering senior Wyatt Shapiro said.   The Mask and Wig Clubâs âAn Eye for an Islandâ will be performed at the Iron Gate Theatre on 37th and Chestnut on Wednesday at 8 PM, Thursday at 7 PM and 9:30 PM, Friday at 7 and 9:30 PM   and Saturday at 7 and 9:30 PM.  \n",

            "The sounds of âart striking a chordâ reverberated through the Rotunda Thursday night. Outside Sound, a project that combines visual artwork by the disabled with music, showcased their works in a public event. All proceeds went toward the purchase of materials and equipment to continue the program. The idea for this event came from composer and Outside Sound Director Chris Coyle, who had interacted with people with mental and developmental disabilities through three nonprofit art programs â Oasis, Center for Creative Works and Outside the Lines. âI am a freelance musician and composer,â Coyle said in an email. âOutside Sound was a way for me to ârespondâ to the fascinating artwork coming from these programs and their disabled artists.â At a hall in the Rotunda, paintings and crafts from disabled artists were exhibited for sale. A few of the artists sat beside their artwork and talked about their pieces to those interested. Stephanie Washington, whose portrait of the actor and martial artist Jim Kelly was on display, said, âIâm a cartoonist, and I get my ideas from characters that I see in movies, television and in real life.â She added, âIt feels good when I draw. Somethingâs wrong if I donât draw.â Attendees rotated through the hall, admiring the artwork and talking to the artists. Later, they gathered around the stage for the nightâs highlight â the combination of music and art. Coyle and his band played a few original compositions centered on a theme inspired from artwork by the disabled community. In an arrangement titled âAnimals,â Coyle and his band played a soft, low, lilting tune as drawings of a moose, a crab, different birds and other figurative creatures flashed on the screen. These drawings were all painted by the disabled. Other arrangements featured different themes of art and accompanying music. Brendan Cooney, the bandâs keyboardist, spoke about the relation between the two media. âMusic enhances the meaning of visual art,â he said. âWhat things mean to us is contextual. We associate an image with a sound or a memory. When you pair an image and a sound, you create a richer, more complex experience.â Violinist Carlos Santiago touched on artâs ability to enrich the musicianâs experience. âA lot of music for this exhibit is based on improvisation. The image we see shapes how we play,â he said. In between songs, videos were shown documenting the process of how the disabled artists at different art programs created their work. In these videos, attendees watched jamming sessions, heard an artist deliberate the pricing of his artwork and listened to more artists explain the motivation for their pieces. Jennifer Powers, the mother of one of the disabled artists involved in a creative arts program, described her own feelings about her daughterâs achievements. âI did not know my daughter was so talented in art â she didnât get that from me,â she said. Powers added that her daughterâs art âhelps her express her personality,â and that through art, she âexpresses things that she canât express though words.â\n",

            "Philadelphia based octet ensemble Relache will perform two shows featuring silent films at the Penn Museum on Sunday, June 1.  The ensemble will play to the background of Hitchcockâs âThe Lodgerâ and âTwilight in Turkeyâ, the latter of which will replace Raymond Scottâs âThe Penguinâ, which they have performed in the past.Sundayâs performance will mark Relacheâs first show at the Penn museum.At the Penn Museum, patrons will be seated during the entire performance, drawing their focus to the musical performance, Haldeman said. In the past, Relache has performed at venues such as the Philadelphia Museum on the grand staircase or in a gallery amidst works of art.âWeâre almost like a part of the art. People come and go; itâs much less formal,â Haldeman said of such performances. âIn the Penn Museum setting, people come in and sit down and are responding to the film and to the accompanying music.â   The concept of playing music to a silent film originated during the silent film era, when films required the accompaniment of an orchestra or performance ensemble. Today, groups like Relache either improvise or perform pieces scored specifically to accompany a silent film.Relache sometimes commissions composers to score pieces to play specifically along with silent films â such as when the octet asked Darin Kelly to arrange Joby Talbottâs score for The Lodger especially for them. Silent film work is a significant part of Relacheâs repertoire as the group has become more widely recognized over the past thirty-five years. Consisting of a flute, oboe, bassoon, viola, clarinet, piano, bass, and percussion, the octet is also in the midst of a new album release.   Relache is excited to collaborate with the Penn Museum. Octet bassoonist and office manager Chuck Haldeman explained that the group never knows what to expect the first time they perform at a new venue. âWeâre performing in Weitner Hall, which is in what you could call the northwest corner of the museum,â Haldeman said. âItâs been remodeled recently with lots of wood. It has terrific acoustics.â \n",

            "In its 50th year, the Institute of Contemporary Art opened what could be its most ambitious project yet: an exhibit of the works of Jason Rhoades, a renowned installation artist who created massive three-dimensional pieces from 1993 to his untimely death in 2006. Although Rhoades lived and worked in California, his work has been widely acclaimed throughout Europe and relatively absent within the United States. The exhibit, titled âJason Rhoades, Four Roads,â which opened last night and will remain at the Institute through Dec. 29, is the first major American exhibition of his art. Ingrid Shaffner, chief curator of ICA as well as this exhibit, described Rhoades in a keynote speech in celebration of his work as a âperpetual motion machine of creation and creativity.â This persona is clearly visible in the four main works on display, which I was able to view along with a group of ICA members and donors. Related: Freshman seminar curates ICA exhibit The entrance to the exhibit was dominated by a makeshift garage, containing a massive Chevrolet engine surrounded by a debris of plastic cups, wires, wood and tools molded out of aluminum foil. Full of references to Rhoadesâ years as a student, the piece included pin-up posters and a Formula One racing suit he wore for an earlier performance. Schaffner described it as one of the many Rhoadesâ pieces that âreads like an archaeological site,â full of relics of his past. âItâs visual poetry, like language expressed in terms of real things,â said Kathy Sachs, former board chair of ICA. âItâs outrageous and exhilarating.â As Ingrid discussed the garage, I couldnât help noticing the sound of voices and several discordant tunes echoing from the next room of the exhibit. As we turned the corner, I realized the noises were emanating from The Creation Myth, the exhibitâs largest installation. An artistic representation of the brain, the piece was an overwhelming construction of motion and noise. We walked through a forest of wooden beams papered with pornographic images, while a stuffed snake, cut in half, was propelled around the perimeters of the piece aboard a toy train. Susie Stamatakos was one of two registrars who participated in the month-long process of unpacking supplies and setting up the exhibit. She considered the most unique aspect of Rhoadesâ work to be his use of household objects, such as buckets and empty Snapple bottles. âOne of the things I unpacked was a piece of bubble wrap wrapped in bubble wrap, marked: âArt. Do not throw away,ââ she said. Related: ICA to offer free admission to all I nearly tripped over one of the orange power chords littering the ground around a fortress constructed of foldable tables. Metallic domes displayed the distorted reflections of passing viewers, many of whom smiled and shook their heads at the overwhelming installation. I struggled to grasp the full spectrum of ideas being presented as I watched a gigantic tarp balloon inflate and deflate next to a black funnel emitting perfect smoke rings that drifted over the scene. âIâm a little bit in awe,â said Mary Beth Royal, a sculpture student at Bucks County Community College, as she stared at the piece with wide eyes. We proceeded up a ramp to the second floor, where a house-shaped structure titled Sutterâs Mill was constructed out of interlocking metallic pipes. Their glistening surfaces reflected hundreds of neon lights â part of another piece, Untitled (from My Madinah: In pursuit of my ermitageâ¦) â that were suspended in the air several yards away. These lights comprised a field of words, each one a different euphemism for âvagina,â which dangled from a lattice of electric cables over a carpet of towels and stools. Viewers were encouraged to take off their shoes and walk beneath the neon sky. Several people laid down on their backs to gaze up at the words as if stargazing. âItâs interesting how thereâs a lot of profanity up in the air, but he also tries to make it very inviting,â said Wharton sophomore Arjan Singh, a member of ICAâs student board. He compared the ironically serene atmosphere of the piece to that of a Sikh temple. Although many viewers seemed overwhelmed by Rhoadesâ bold and intrusive pieces, they still couldnât deny their power. âItâs hard to find a vocabulary to talk about it,â said Janice Volkman, one of the many adults attracted to the exhibitâs grand opening. âBeautiful isnât the right wordâ¦ itâs startling.â This article has been revised to reflect that Shaffer is not only the chief curator of âJason Rhoades, Four Roads,â but also of ICA.\n",

            "According to â08 alumna Rebecca Kantor, her grandfather, world-renowned architect Louis Kahn was fascinated with beginnings. But while much is known about Kahnâs later life, his early childhood remains shrouded. In a discussion last night in the Kelly Writers House, Kantor sought to move through this fog and reconstruct the beginnings that shaped a great man. In her talk, Kantor discussed her travels to Kahnâs birthplace and her findings on his early childhood. She hopes to share her grandfatherâs past in her upcoming book, âVolume Zero: Uncovering Louis I. Kahnâs Baltic Origins.â  Kantor explained that she first became curious about her grandfatherâs life as a senior at Penn. In her research over the past few years, Kantor visited several cities that were significant to her grandfatherâs life in order to better understand the family dynamics that shaped him as a person. Some of Kahnâs architecture is said to be based upon the burns on his face and hands obtained as a child trying to pick up hot coals, Kantor explained. This, she said, is an example of how a personâs beginning has âpotential to shape and form a person.â Kantor first journeyed to Kahnâs birthplace, Riga, now the capital of modern Latvia. There, Kantor visited Kahnâs ancestorsâ apartments, as well as exploring the architecture of the city itself. Next, Kantor traveled to the city of Sloka, west of Riga in modern Latvia. Having discovered that Kahnâs father, Leopold, descended from the Traines family, Kantor combined family narratives to trace the extended familyâs origins back to Sloka. The last leg of Kantorâs journey was to the town of Kuressaare on the island Saaremaa, Estonia. Kahnâs mother, Bertha, and her family had owned a hotel in the city center in 1917 and Kahnâs father had worked in the basement of the cityâs castle as a clerk. Kantor discovered that Kahn returned to Saaremaa for only a day in 1928, where he was met with the neoclassical style buildings in the city center and older wooden buildings on the city outskirts. \n",

            "In preparation for the release of Pixarâs newest animated film, \"The Good Dinosaur,\" on Nov. 25, Pixarâs character art director Matt Nolte visited University City on Thursday night. Nolte talked to students about the animation process and gave a sneak peak of the movie itself. Nolte has been involved with Pixar for the past 11 years, joining the company after studying at the California Institute of the Arts. He has worked on character art for movies such as \"Cars,\" \"Ratatouille,\" \"Brave\" and most recently, \"The Good Dinosaur.\"The movie revolves around a young dinosaur, Arlo, who gets lost in nature and meets a young boy named Spot. The pair wander the terrain, haphazardly trying to find their way while simultaneously appreciating the beauty of nature. Nolte said that properly portraying natureâs stunning landscapes was of the utmost priority for the artistic team.In order to properly capture the magic of the landscape, director Peter Sohn along with producer Denise Ream and a host of Pixar artists traveled to a number of places in the American Northwest. \"That way, when they see it firsthand, they don't have a problem with cliches or anything like that,\" Nolte said.\"We went into it hoping to get lost â to have that feeling that anything can happen without warning,\" Ream added. Preview clips of \"The Good Dinosaur\" captured this sense of adventure. The videos showed Arlo falling down a waterfall, climbing a cliff with the Teton mountains towering in the distance and running through a field of predators.Nolteâs talk also gave audiences a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes work of an animated film, providing more details on what it's like to be a character art director.  âI take direction from the director and see what he wants, then I go think of fun ideas that match his vision and draw them out,\" he said. \"Those sketches go through art reviews where we get notes and feelings about them, and then we make another draft. After a drawing is approved â¦ we have to turn it from 2-D into 3-D.â With some characters taking multiple drafts and others only a few, Nolte added that animating an animated film can take anywhere from three to four, even five years.Nolte advised all aspiring animators to âdraw a lot.\" \"Draw what you like, rather than what you think the industry wants to see. Find the people you dream to be, contact them, ask them to look at your work,\" he said. \"Iâd say people looking at my work is the only reason Iâm here right now.â\n",

            "Yesterday at professional organist Peter Krasinskiâs master class, âThe Art of Accompanying Silent Films,â curious students found that silent films can, in fact, speak through music. Krasinskiâs class â part of the Universityâs âYear of Soundâ programming â covered the art of improvising scores to silent movies on the Curtis Organ, housed in Irvine Auditorium. Because Krasinski never composes scores in advance, each performance is a unique experience that varies with every venue and audience. Krasinski began his class by laying out his technique for scoring the films. He explained that before each performance, he first watches the film to get a feel for the scenes â whether they are happy, tragic, comedic or eerie. He also considers the action of the scene, accompanying it in a method known as âMickey Mousing,â in which the music supports what is happening on screen, adding depth to the moment and speaking in place of the characters. Then began the exemplification of these techniques. Krasinskiâs first piece accompanied a clip from the 1902 French film A Trip to the Moon. Here he illustrated the âMickey Mousingâ method, creating music that matched the exaggerated movements in scenes portraying characters building a rocket ship. The music fit so naturally with the scene that it was amazing to realize it was being created on the spot. Clip from Nosferatu and The Phantom of the Opera were then played as examples of horror films, appropriate for the Halloween season. Strange, dissonant sounds were used to create a creepy theme. Krasinskiâs technique is often used to highlight the disturbing nature of the films he scores and add to their foreboding atmosphere. Doug Backman, a longtime admirer of Krasinski who has attended many of his past performances, praised Krasinskiâs productions as âamazing, theyâre different every time. It was different at three and it will be different at seven.â Krasinski explained that comedy films are the most difficult to accompany, due to the need to not upstage the comedianâs performance. The actor must remain the comedian, he said, and the composer must not interfere with their performance. This was followed with a backing of Charlie Chaplinâs Modern Times. Krasinski ended the course with a discussion session, requesting that all return for the showing of âDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,â which he would be accompanying on the Curtis Organ later in the evening. Krasinski typically plays along to a silent film in Irvine Auditorium every Halloween night.\n"
